description: Proactively connect to apps and hot reload

Whenever you make edits to any Dart or Flutter files in this project:
1. Proactively connect to the running application using the `dtd` tool and its subcommands. Make sure to read the schema for this tool.
2. Trigger a hot reload using the `hot_reload` tool to push the changes immediately.
3. If no app is running, inform the user but do not let it stop you from completing the code edits.
