/**
 * React render meter — counts commits the way React DevTools does, via the global
 * `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.onCommitFiberRoot` callback (one call per committed render). This is
 * the Reticle-only perf signal: Playwright/DevTools-MCP cannot observe a single React render, so a page
 * that is thrashing (committing many times a second) while the DOM stays visually identical — a
 * wasted-render storm — looks idle to them. Reticle sees the commit rate.
 *
 * Exposed as a registered store (`__reticle_renders`) so it reads through the normal `reticle_state` path —
 * no new wire surface. Total commits is the robust, version-tolerant signal; we deliberately do NOT
 * attribute per-component (React clears the per-fiber work flags during commit, before this fires, so
 * a post-commit walk can't reliably tell which component re-rendered without the profiler build).
 *
 * HOST-SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION: everything is wrapped in try/catch and React itself guards its calls to
 * the devtools hook in try/catch, so a fault here can never break the host app's rendering. If a real
 * React DevTools hook is already present we AUGMENT it (call the original too); otherwise we install a
 * complete minimal hook. MUST be installed before `react-dom` initializes (React reads the hook at
 * renderer-inject time) — import this as the first side-effect in the app entry, before React.
