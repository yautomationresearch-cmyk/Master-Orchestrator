//! The capture command, in its own module because `#[tauri::command]` re-exports a macro beside the
//! function — at the crate root that collides with the function's own re-export.
//!
//! Each platform reaches its webview through a different API, but all three share the property that
//! matters: they render the WEBVIEW, never the screen. Capturing a screen region instead was tried
//! and rejected — it photographs the glass, so a window sitting behind the editor yields a picture of
//! the editor, banked as a visual baseline a later diff would trust. None of these can do that, none
//! needs a screen-recording permission, and all three are correct with nothing on screen at all.
