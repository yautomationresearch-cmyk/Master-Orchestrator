/**
 * Rule: no-internal-tags.
 *
 * Bans design-doc reference codes and internal version strings from comments, so a reader of the source
 * never meets a token that only means something in a document they cannot see.
 *
 * This rule exists because the prose version of it did not hold. An audit of the codebase found the
 * machine-checked rules at ~100% compliance and every prose-only rule violated — 59 tracking codes
 * across the library packages alone, including in the contract package and in test descriptions, plus
 * codes that leaked into user-facing docs. The gap was enforcement, not intent, so the rule is now a
 * lint error rather than a paragraph.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, to avoid punishing legitimate prose:
 *   - a bare `W11`, `B37`, `N5`, `M8` style token (one or two capitals + digits) standing alone;
 *   - a section reference like `§4.3`;
 *   - an internal version string like `v2.2.0`.
 * Ordinary technical prose that happens to contain a letter and digits inside a larger word (`UTF-8`,
 * `H2`, `Welford M2` when part of a sentence) is matched only when it stands alone as a tag.
