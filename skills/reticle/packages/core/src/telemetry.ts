/**
 * Anonymous product telemetry — the contract for how the OSS `reticle` runtime reports ADOPTION
 * (not verification results): is it installed, how often is it invoked, which tools get used, how many
 * distinct machines/projects run it. This is what turns "npm downloads" (which an investor discounts)
 * into DAU/WAU/MAU, active sessions, and retention. Uninstall/churn is deliberately NOT an event —
 * npm 7+/pnpm run no uninstall lifecycle scripts, so churn is inferred server-side from inactivity.
 *
 * Privacy is structural, not a policy: the ONLY identifiers on the wire are a random per-machine UUID
 * (`anonymousId`, minted locally, never derived from anything personal) and a one-way HASH of the
 * project (`projectId`) — no repo name, no path, no email, no code. The ONE exception is the
 * `feedback` event, and it is an exception by consent, not by accident: it carries text a human typed
 * or an agent wrote, it is NEVER emitted passively (only from an explicit `reticle_feedback` call or
 * `reticle feedback` command), and it has its own kill switch. It is strictly opt-OUT (respects
 * `RETICLE_TELEMETRY=0` and the `DO_NOT_TRACK` convention) and best-effort (a failed send never touches
 * the tool's behaviour). Same conventions as the rest of core: enums are `as const` narrowed with
 * `z.nativeEnum`, timestamps are epoch-ms NUMBERS, no `any`.
