// legitimate reticle_inspect/reticle_state output.

// boundary-anchored the same way: it targets the `Cookie` / `Set-Cookie` HTTP HEADER names (which
// bundle the session credential and were the one wire payload reaching the journal + the agent
// unredacted), NOT any key that merely contains the substring — `scopecookie`, `cookieConsent`,
// `cookiePolicy` are legitimate app values an agent may need to read, and stay visible.
