   * gone" — never moves, and observations of code the agent has already rewritten go on answering
   * for it in silence.
   *
   * Reported rather than EXCLUDED, and the difference from the document case is deliberate. A
   * navigation is total: it throws away the page, the refs, the in-flight requests and the state, so
   * nothing recorded under it is still about the world. An edit is not. Most modules, most of the
   * DOM, the whole network log and every console line survive a hot update, so most of what was
   * observed a second before it is still true a second after. Dropping that window would empty
   * verdicts that hold real findings, and an emptied window reads as "nothing happened" — the more
   * expensive of the two wrong answers, and the one this family of checks exists to prevent.

   * So the evidence stays and the caveat is said out loud: absence-derived, because nothing here
   * claims the app is wrong. It downgrades a verdict to unknown, which is the honest reading of
   * "you changed the code and then looked only at what happened before you did".

/**
 * Contradictions inferred from the ABSENCE of evidence in a window whose end Reticle itself chose.

 * The distinction is not cosmetic — it decides whether Reticle is entitled to say an action FAILED.
 * The other kinds are things we positively observed: a request came back 500 while the UI advanced,
 * a signal fired carrying data that disagrees with the DOM, a written field echoed a different
 * value. Those are evidence AGAINST the action, and they must keep outranking a passing assertion,
 * because a green assertion sitting on top of a failed write is the entire bug class this product
 * exists to catch.
 *
 * These five are different. Each says "the thing I expected to see had not happened YET when I
 * stopped looking" — and the window closes the moment the predicate first passes, which on an app
 * that navigates optimistically is routinely before the network drains. Reproduced on the bench app:
 * `auth:granted` fired WITH matching data, application state changed, the token was stored, capture
 * integrity was clean and the honesty grade was `signal` — our strongest evidence class — and the
 * verdict was still `no`, because one POST had not settled. A timing observation overruled a
 * consequence observation, which inverts the grade hierarchy the verifier is built on.
 *
 * A false negative is not the mirror of a false positive here. A false positive stops an agent
 * early; a false NEGATIVE makes it redo work that already succeeded, or stop trusting the verdict
 * channel — and the verdict channel is the product. `bug.attribution` was deleted for exactly this
 * reason: every `attribution: 'app'` on `request-never-settled` turned out to be a misattribution.
 * We removed the field and left the verdict.
 *
 * So these downgrade a verdict to UNKNOWN rather than asserting NO. The finding is still reported in
 * `contradictions` either way — nothing is hidden, and an agent that wants to wait and re-check has
 * everything it needs to.
