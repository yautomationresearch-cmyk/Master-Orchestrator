 * it decides when "green" actually means the feature worked. It was implemented three times over
 * (flow classification, ad-hoc assert grading, flow-success compilation); keeping the vocabulary here
 * means a contributor can never strengthen one grader and silently leave the others weaker.

 * exactly the drift this file exists to prevent, and a typo in a free-string branch is not a compile
