 * The desktop contract has to hold across module systems that cannot import each other: a CommonJS
 * Electron preload, the ESM renderer SDK, and the Node daemon. It used to hold because six files
 * hand-copied the same strings, and a rename in any one broke desktop silently.
 *
 * Now the CommonJS view is GENERATED from the TypeScript source, so drift is not something to police
 * — it is impossible by construction. What is still worth asserting is that the generator stays
 * honest and that the committed build output is current.
