/**
 * The impact record: what Reticle has actually done for this user, and what that is worth.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from calls that really happened - the dispatch chokepoint counts them
 * - and is stored locally. Two kinds of number live in this file and they are NOT interchangeable:
 *
 *   MEASURED  - counted from real calls (tokens returned, verdicts, defects, sessions, minutes).
 *   ESTIMATED - a comparison against a run that did not happen (tokens/minutes SAVED). Every one of
 *               these carries the baseline it is measured against, because a saving without its
 *               denominator is not a claim, it is a slogan - and this project has already been
 *               bitten by publishing one ("2574x cheaper" compares against an LLM re-drive, not a
 *               compiled suite).
 *
 * The UI must render the two differently and must never present an estimate as a count.
