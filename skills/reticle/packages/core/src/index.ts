 * API-stability note: the exports below the divider are INTERNAL cross-package plumbing — they are
 * re-exported so the other @reticlehq/* packages can share one implementation, NOT as a stable surface
 * for outside consumers. They can change in a minor release. Depend on the STABLE section for anything
 * outside this monorepo. (A dedicated `@reticlehq/core/internal` entry point is a 3.0 consideration; for
 * now the boundary is documented here.)
