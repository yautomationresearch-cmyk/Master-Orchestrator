   *
   * Literal `keys` strings also cross the bridge, so the daemon redacts them on the driven path,
   * where request bodies are captured raw from the network stack and never pass through this SDK.
   * RegExp entries and `allow` do NOT cross - see docs/usage.md ("Extending the redaction rules") for why, and what that means.
