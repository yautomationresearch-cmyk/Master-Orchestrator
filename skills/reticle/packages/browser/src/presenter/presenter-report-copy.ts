/**
 * What the report SAYS, kept away from how it looks.
 *
 * The wording here is the product's only claim about its own worth, so it is written once, in one
 * place, and tested. Two audiences, two registers:
 *
 *  - The REPORT is private. It is the user's own data, so it can carry everything, estimates
 *    included, as long as each estimate shows what it is measured against.
 *  - The SHARE card is public, and the research on developer stat-cards is blunt about what happens
 *    to a public card that leads with vendor savings: estimated token/time savings are the most
 *    mocked class of number in AI tooling (JetBrains measured ~10% against a viral 65% claim), and
 *    percentiles without a denominator get called misleading. So the card leads with what the
 *    user's own setup CAUGHT, and publishes its unknowns - the credibility move, and the thing a
 *    scoreboard would never do.
