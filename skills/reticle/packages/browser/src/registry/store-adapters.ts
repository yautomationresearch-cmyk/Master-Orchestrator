 *
 * `registerStore` duck-types on `{getState, subscribe}`, which zustand and Redux satisfy natively — so
 * those two needed nothing and got support for free. Everything else was unserved, and the gap was not
 * evenly distributed: by weekly npm downloads TanStack Query (~64M) is larger than zustand (~46M) and
 * redux (~39M), and it holds the state most likely to be WRONG in a way nothing else can see.
 *
 * That last point is the reason this file exists rather than a docs page. A stale-cache bug — the UI
 * rendering data the server has since changed, a mutation that never invalidated its query, an
 * optimistic update that was never rolled back — fires NO network request. An outside-in tool watching
 * the network sees silence and calls it healthy; the DOM shows a plausible number. The only witness is
 * the cache itself, and until now Reticle could not read it either.
 *
 * Every adapter here is a pure function returning `{getState, subscribe}`. None of them import their
 * library — they take an already-constructed client/store/proxy and use structural types, so this file
 * adds no dependency and no bundle weight for an app that uses none of them.

 * Expose a chosen set of Recoil atoms as one Reticle store.

 *    atoms, so "the whole store" is not a thing that exists. Naming the atoms is the only way to
 *    snapshot them, and it doubles as a declaration of what matters — the same reason `jotaiStore`
 *    takes one.
 *  - **`.state`/`.contents`, never `.getValue()`.** On a pending async selector `getValue()` THROWS
 *    the pending promise, and on a failed one it throws the error. Either would take down the whole
 *    state read over one slow atom — so a loading atom reports `status: 'loading'` with a null value
 *    rather than silently becoming an empty object or an exception.
 *  - **One subscription, not one per atom.** Recoil exposes no per-atom subscription outside React
 *    (`jotaiStore` gets `store.sub(atom, …)`; there is no equivalent here). The transaction stream is
 *    the only public change signal, so the caller passes it in — the same "the library ships free
 *    functions, so hand them over" shape as `valtioStore` and `mobxStore`.
 *
 * Wire it from a bridge component, which is where `useRecoilTransactionObserver_UNSTABLE` lives:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const latest = useRef(snapshot_UNSTABLE());
 * const listeners = useRef(new Set<() => void>()).current;
 * useRecoilTransactionObserver_UNSTABLE(({ snapshot }) => {
 *   latest.current = snapshot;
 *   for (const l of listeners) l();
