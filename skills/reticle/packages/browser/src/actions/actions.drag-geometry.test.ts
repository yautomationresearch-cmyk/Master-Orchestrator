/**
 * A drag has to carry coordinates, or it is a false green in our own tooling.
 *
 * Reported by an agent driving a `@dnd-kit/core` board: `reticle_act { action: "drag" }` returned
 * `ok:true`, `dispatched:true`, `effect.domMutatedWithin:0` — and the card had not moved. dnd-kit
 * resolves the `over` droppable from collision GEOMETRY, and every pointer event we dispatched was
 * built as `new PointerEvent(type, { bubbles, cancelable })`, so both source and target reported
 * `(0,0)`. Zero delta, so `onDragEnd` sees `over === source`, and the app is unchanged while the
 * tool reports success. That is the one failure mode this product exists to catch, produced by the
 * product.
 *
 * Three properties are needed and all three were missing:
 *
 *  - **coordinates**, so a geometry-based library can tell source from target at all;
 *  - **`buttons: 1` on the moves**, because the standard "was the mouse released?" guard is
 *    `event.buttons === 0` — a second reporter's drag-select bailed on exactly that;
 *  - **intermediate moves**, because `activationConstraint: { distance: N }` is the standard config
 *    for keeping a draggable card clickable, and one jump from A to B never crosses the threshold
 *    in a way the sensor observes.
 *
 * Also here: `press` set `key` and never `code`. dnd-kit's KeyboardSensor, react-aria and anything
 * keyed on physical keys match on `code`, so the keyboard fallback was unavailable too.
