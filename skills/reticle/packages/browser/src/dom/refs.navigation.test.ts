/**
 * A ref minted before a full navigation must never resolve after one.
 *
 * The stale-ref refusal was closed for SPA route changes and open for full navigations, which is the
 * more dangerous half. Refs are minted per DOCUMENT — a reload or a cross-page link tears the module
 * down and the next document starts minting from `e1` again — so `e7` from page A is a valid,
 * resolvable, DIFFERENT element on page B. Nothing refused: the wrong element was clicked and the
 * result reported `ok`. That is a false green we produce, which is the one category of defect this
 * product cannot ship.
 *
 * The fix does NOT change the wire format. Refs stay `e<n>` and the sequence simply never restarts:
 * each document reserves a block of numbers in `sessionStorage` before minting, so page B's `e7`
 * cannot exist. A stale ref then misses the map and the EXISTING refusal fires, already worded for
 * exactly this ("Reticle refuses here rather than clicking whatever now occupies that slot"). No new
 * ref grammar, no round-trip concern for the agents that pass refs back verbatim, and no migration
 * for the refs already sitting in saved flows on disk.
 *
 * `sessionStorage` is the right scope for the same reason session continuity uses it: it survives
 * reloads and same-tab navigations, and is not shared with another tab — where a second tab is a
 * second session with its own registry anyway.
