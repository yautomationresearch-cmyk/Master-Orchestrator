/**
 * The one element a scoped query excludes is the scope itself — and sometimes that is the target.
 *
 * Reported by an agent verifying a drag-select: the element carrying the `mousedown` handler was a
 * CSS-grid row, and the bug lived in clicking its EMPTY region. It is a plain `div` — no role, no
 * accessible name, no testid, no text of its own beyond its children's — so every semantic locator
 * missed it, and `scope: ".grid-lists"` returned its 56 DESCENDANTS while excluding the one element
 * wanted. Clicking a child card was not a substitute: the card's own handler fires after mouseup and
 * overwrites the state under test.
 *
 * The verification could not run at all. It was handed back to the human — the second gesture that
 * session that had to be.
 *
 * `self: true` makes the scope root itself a candidate. It reuses the CSS escape hatch `scope`
 * already has rather than introducing a second, competing locator: a semantic query stays the way to
 * find things, and this is the way to name something the page never labelled.
