 * element on page B — nothing refused, the wrong element was acted on, and the result came back `ok`.
 * The SPA case was always safe (WeakRef liveness + isConnected); this was the other half, and the
 * more dangerous one, because it produced a false green instead of an error.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a change to the ref grammar. Stamping refs `e7@3` would have worked too, but every
 * agent passes refs back verbatim and every saved flow on disk already holds bare ones, so it buys a
 * wire-format migration for a property the sequence itself can carry. A number that never restarts
 * means a stale ref simply misses the map, and the refusal that already exists — already worded for
 * exactly this case — fires unchanged.
 *

 * mints is free.
 *
 * Sized to keep refs SHORT, and the first attempt at that reasoned about the wrong axis. It bounded
 * how many navigations it took to reach seven digits and concluded "a hundred" — but the cost is not
 * paid at seven digits, it is paid at every digit, on every ref, in every snapshot and every error
 * message, on every turn. At 10,000 the SECOND document already mints five-digit refs.
 *
 * Measured on one unchanged three-element page across a session: 61 tokens on the first document,
 * 64 after a reload, 65 later — +6.5% for the same page, entirely in ref width. The benchmark saw the
 * same thing as a ~4% rise in average observation cost, which is what a benchmark is for.
 *
 * So the block is small. A document claims another one when it outmints this, which costs one more
 * storage write and is exactly proportional: a page with thousands of elements has a long snapshot
 * anyway, and a small page — the common case, and the one an agent drives repeatedly — keeps
 * three-digit refs across dozens of navigations.
