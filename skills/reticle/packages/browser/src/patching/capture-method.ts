/**
 * Capture a method off an object so it can be restored — or re-invoked via `.call` — later.
 *
 * Monkeypatching is unavoidable in this SDK: observing history, console, fetch and XHR means
 * replacing a method and putting the original back on teardown. Putting it back requires holding the
 * UNBOUND original, because identity is what teardown compares — a bound copy is a different function
 * and would leave the patch installed forever.
 *
 * `@typescript-eslint/unbound-method` exists to catch the common mistake this pattern deliberately
 * makes, so every such site used to carry an eslint-disable. Disabling a rule seven times to express
 * one intention is worse than naming the intention once: those disables also suppressed the rule for
 * any OTHER unbound access on the same lines, which is exactly what the rule is for.
 *
 * The generic index access here is not something the rule flags, so callers stay clean and the
 * "I meant to do this" is stated in one place instead of seven.
