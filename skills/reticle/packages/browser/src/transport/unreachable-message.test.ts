/**
 * The page reports what its own socket did, never what the daemon is doing.
 *
 * The SDK runs inside the browser. When its websocket does not open, the one thing it knows is that
 * its socket did not open, to a named address, N times. It cannot see whether a daemon is listening,
 * because "nothing answered me" and "something answered somebody else" are indistinguishable from
 * where it stands. The old message asked "Is the Reticle daemon running on that port?", which reads
 * as a diagnosis, and it was reported firing while the daemon was up and serving that exact session.
 *
 * A wrong cause costs more than no cause: no cause prompts investigation, a wrong cause ends it. An
 * agent told the daemon is down goes and restarts a healthy daemon, which is calls spent and, on a
 * shared port, somebody else's session taken out.
 *
 * The failures this page genuinely cannot tell apart are all reachability, not liveness: a daemon on
 * another host (container, devcontainer, WSL), an https page that may not open a `ws://` socket at
 * all, a wrong port. So the message states the observation, states that it is not evidence about the
 * daemon, and then lists the checks in the order that resolves them.
 *
 * Part of https://github.com/reticlehq/reticle/issues/310, whose rule is: report what you observed
 * and what you could not determine, never a cause.
