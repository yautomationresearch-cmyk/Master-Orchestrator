 * the transport schedules through `nativeSetTimeout`, bound to the real timer at module load so a
 * frozen `reticle_clock` cannot deadlock the SDK. So the clock never advanced anything, no retry
 * ever ran, and `failNTimes` was re-closing the SAME socket — a sequence a real WebSocket cannot
 * produce, since `onclose` fires once.
 *
 * Proven vacuous by mutation: disabling reconnect entirely (`#scheduleReopen` returning immediately)
 * left all three tests GREEN. They asserted the failure COUNTER, never the retry loop it counts.
 *
 * The injected `schedule` seam records each pending retry so it can be run deliberately, which also
 * makes each failure a genuinely new socket.
