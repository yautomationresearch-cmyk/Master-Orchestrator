/**
 * Install every page observer, guarded.
 *
 * Extracted from `reticle.ts` because it is one job with one rule, and because that file is the SDK's
 * public surface — the more of this that lived there, the harder it was to see what `connect()`
 * actually does.
 *
 * THE RULE: one observer failing must never stop the others. This array used to be built bare, so a
 * single `install*` that threw took the whole `connect()` down with it — one bad patch on one exotic
 * page and the app got no instrumentation at all, silently, because the SDK\'s own catch blocks
 * ensured nobody ever found out. Each install is now wrapped: the healthy observers still run, the
 * failure is reported over the bridge, and the caller gets a teardown list of the same length.
