/**
 * Blind spots that IMPEACH the capture, as opposed to bounding what it covers.
 *
 * The distinction decides whether a verdict is downgraded to UNKNOWN or merely carries a caveat, and
 * conflating them breaks the tool in one direction or the other:
 *
 *  - **Impeaching**: events were DROPPED, so the window itself is a sample and any claim over it may
 *    be a false negative. Nothing observed can be trusted to be complete.
 *  - **Bounding**: a region is structurally unobservable — a cross-origin frame, a closed shadow
 *    root, the 9,970 virtualized rows that were never rendered. What WAS observed is completely and
 *    correctly observed; there is simply a boundary, and it is usually permanent.
 *
 * Treating the second kind as impeaching made every verdict on any virtualized list UNKNOWN — which
 * is most data-heavy software, permanently. A tool that answers "unknown" to everything is as
 * useless as one that answers "yes" to everything, and it is the same failure: a verdict that does
 * not depend on the evidence.
