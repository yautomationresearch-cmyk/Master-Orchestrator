/**
 * An `unknown` an agent cannot act on ends the drive.
 *
 * `unsettled` is the commonest reason a verdict comes back `unknown`, and the whole of what it said
 * was that the page "never settled" — equally true of a page that polls, a page that animates, and a
 * page whose write is still open, which need three different next moves. This pins that the sentence
 * names the wait, what the window held when the budget ran out, and the one thing to try next.
