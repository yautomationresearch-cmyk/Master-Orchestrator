/**
 * Of the controls this session drove, how many could Reticle fully observe?
 *
 * The first honest denominator this product has ever had. `reticle_verify{action:"coverage"}`
 * already answers "which controls did you not drive"; this answers the question underneath it —
 * *of the ones you did drive, how many could the app actually answer for?* A high untouched-count is
 * work remaining for the agent. A low observability is work remaining in the APP, and no amount of
 * driving closes it.
 *
 * ## Two things it deliberately refuses to do
 *
 * **It does not report a percentage for an empty run.** 0/0 rendered as 100% is the most flattering
 * possible reading of no evidence at all, and a coverage number that starts perfect is one nobody
 * believes the first time it drops.
 *
 * **It does not count app-level gaps against a control.** An unregistered store or an unsignalled
 * route is missing from the application, not from a button. Attributing it to whichever control
 * happened to be driven would put the number on the wrong thing and make it move for reasons the
 * agent cannot act on. Those gaps are reported alongside, not divided into.

/**
 * The floor under the number, shipped with it rather than after it.
 *
 * A coverage figure with no downgrade check is a figure that gets gamed, and we would be the ones
 * teaching agents to game it: the cheapest way to stop a gap firing is to stop asserting the thing
 * that revealed it. The same reasoning already runs for flow assertions in `assertion-tiers-store`,
 * where a flow that passes more weakly than it used to is a finding rather than a pass.
 *
 * Returns undefined — not a false — when there is nothing honest to compare. A first run has no
 * best to fall from, and a run that drove almost nothing is evidence of a short session rather than
 * of a regression.
