/**
 * What "a false green Reticle caught" can and cannot mean, pinned at the rule that decides it.
 *
 * The metric that counts them is defined as `passed && 'no' === verified`, and its own comment reads
 * "the assertion PASSED and Reticle still refused to call it verified". Those are not the same
 * statement, and this file is the difference between them.
 *
 * `decideVerified` refuses a passing assertion in seven ways, and exactly ONE of them answers `no`:
 * a channel that positively disagreed. Every other refusal answers `unknown`, deliberately and for a
 * reason this package is built on — UNKNOWN must never collapse into NO, because "I could not see"
 * and "it is broken" send an agent in opposite directions. So a green that proved nothing because
 * the condition already held, a green at a grade that could not have failed, and a green over a
 * write whose outcome was never read are all refusals of a passing assertion that the metric cannot
 * count, by construction rather than by circumstance.
 *
 * This test does not change what is counted. It fixes the shape of the rule in place so that
 * changing it is a decision somebody makes on purpose: if a clause below ever moves from UNKNOWN to
 * NO, the meaning of that metric changes with it, silently, and a metric whose definition drifted is
 * worse than one that reads zero.
