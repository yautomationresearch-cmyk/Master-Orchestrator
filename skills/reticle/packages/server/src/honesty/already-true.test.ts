/**
 * `verified: "yes"` for a navigation that never happened.
 *
 * Measured in the field, on a Next app-router fixture:
 *
 *   act_and_wait { ref: <"Parallel Routes" link>, until: { kind: 'text', contains: 'Parallel Routes' } }
 *   -> verdict at 478ms, verified: "yes", routeChanges: 0
 *   observe -> the real route.change landed at t=22270, ~1.8s LATER
 *
 * The predicate matched the nav link that was already on the page before the click. It was right by
 * accident, and only `honesty.grade: "presence"` and `routeChanges: 0` hinted otherwise — neither is
 * the field an agent reads first.
 *
 * Event-based predicates (net/signal/route) are already floored at the act's cursor, so a stale event
 * cannot satisfy them. `element` and `text` read the LIVE DOM, where no floor applies: a condition
 * that held BEFORE the action holds after it, and passes instantly whatever the action did.
 *
 * So the rule: if a DOM-state predicate was already true before the act, its passing afterwards is
 * not evidence about the act. That is `unknown` — the same answer a dirty capture gets, for the same
 * reason. It is deliberately not `no`: the app may well be fine, and claiming a failure would be its
 * own false report.
