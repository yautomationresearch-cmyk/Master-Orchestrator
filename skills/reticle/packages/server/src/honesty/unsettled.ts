/**
 * What an `unsettled` verdict was waiting for, and what its window held instead.
 *
 * `unsettled` is the commonest reason a verdict comes back `unknown`, and all it said was that the
 * page "never settled" — a sentence equally true of a page that polls, a page that animates, and a
 * page whose write is still open. Those need three different next moves, and an agent handed the
 * sentence cannot tell which it is holding, so the drive stops there. An `unknown` that explains
 * itself is a retry; one that does not is a dead end.
 *
 * Two releases already tuned this window and neither is undone here. The budget is still spent in
 * full before anything is called unsettled (settle-in-flight.ts), and the app is still given its
 * reaction window before any accusation (waitForReaction). This only describes what was true at the
 * moment the budget genuinely ran out.
 *
 * It rides in `because`, beside `verifiedReason`, rather than in a field of its own: the verdict has
 * one sentence an agent is known to read, and a caveat parked anywhere else is a caveat nobody reads.
