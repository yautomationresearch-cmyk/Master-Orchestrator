/**
 * Were `reticle_context` and `reticle_intent` used at all — and did using them change anything?
 *
 * Both shipped with the same pre-registered disproof: *if agents never call it, cut it*. Nothing
 * recorded whether they were called, so the disproof could never be run, and a feature whose
 * disproof cannot be run is one nobody can kill. This is the smallest thing that makes the question
 * answerable, per session, locally — an instrument, not a scold. The numbers exist so a FEATURE can
 * be removed, never so an agent can be blamed for how it drove.
 *
 * ## Fold first, record only what nothing records
 *
 * Three of the four questions are already answerable from what is on disk. The intent ledger says
 * what was declared; the journal says what was driven and what verdicts were drawn. Those are folded
 * here and never re-stored, for the reason `run-context.ts` gives at length: two ways to compute one
 * number is worse than one way.
 *
 * The journal does NOT record read-only calls — it holds actions and verdicts only. So "was
 * `reticle_context` called" has no ledger to fold, and that one thing is recorded, in memory, on the
 * session, by `CaptureLedger`. It is the whole of the new state.
 *
 * ## Absent is not zero
 *
 * A session this daemon has recorded nothing for — journaling off, a session adopted after the fact
 * — reports `observed: false` and states no counts at all. It has not established that the features
 * went unused; it has established that it was not watching. This repo has shipped the other bug
 * twice.
 */

/**
 * The calls this instrument needs and the journal does not keep.
 *
 * Deliberately a short explicit list rather than "everything that is not an action". Under-inclusion
 * is the safe direction: a read tool missing from here lowers the hit side and the miss side by the
 * same call, so the comparison the disproof turns on stays fair. Over-inclusion is not — a lifecycle
 * or disk-side tool landing in here would be counted as a "read" the agent made of the app, which it
 * was not.

/**
 * Did calling `reticle_context` change what happened next?
 *
 * The mechanical proxy, stated so it can be argued with: look at the very next recorded call. If an
 * action was dispatched before it — the action counter moved — the agent ACTED, and the context
 * plausibly helped. If instead the next call is a read of a subject the context had just supplied,
 * the agent re-fetched what it had been handed, and the context did not help.
 *
 * ## What this proxy CANNOT see
 *
 *  - Whether the agent READ the response, reasoned over it, or wrote a better answer from it. There
 *    is no signal for that anywhere, and this must not be mistaken for one.
 *  - Anything that happens between two Reticle calls: source edits, calls to other MCP servers, a
 *    turn ending, a human interrupting. A long gap is invisible and reads as adjacency.
 *  - Reads that name no ref or target (a whole-page snapshot). They land in `readOther`, never in
 *    `refetched`, so a snapshot that duplicated the context is under-counted, not over-counted.
 *  - Causation. `acted` is proximity in a call sequence, nothing more. An agent that would have acted
 *    anyway is indistinguishable from one the context unblocked.
 *  - `reticle_context` called with no session connected — it answers there by design, and there is no
 *    per-session ledger to record it against, so those calls are missing entirely.
 *  - Two agents driving one session. Their calls interleave into one sequence and "next call" stops
 *    meaning "next thing that agent did".
