 * The in-flight command table for one session: correlate a reply to its request, time out the ones

 * entry is either resolved, rejected, or timed out exactly once, and its timer is always cleared —
 * and because Session had grown past the file-size cap. Nothing here knows about health, events, or
 * the browser; it takes the timeout message as a callback so the diagnosis stays with the code that

 * A distinct type because the two ways a command can fail mean opposite things, and a caller that
 * cannot tell them apart will do the wrong thing with one of them. A rejection from a replaced
 * transport says the question never reached the page and is worth asking again; a timeout says it
 * did reach the page, which did not answer in the time granted — and asking again spends a budget
 * that is already gone. Retrying a timeout as though it were a disconnect turned one read into
 * hundreds of commands on the wire against a page that was reconnecting in a loop.
