/**
 * The message that ends most sessions.
 *
 * The field data behind this is unambiguous in shape: most sessions that call any tool make exactly
 * one call and stop, the single commonest of those calls is `reticle_sessions`, and most of them
 * never touch a browser afterwards. Nearly every recorded session error was the same message:
 *
 *   "no browser session connected. Two things to check: (1) your app is running with
 *    @reticlehq/browser enabled, and (2) it points at THIS daemon's port"
 *
 * It is accurate and it is fatal. It names two things the agent cannot check from where it stands
 * and gives it nothing to DO, so the agent abandons the tool for the rest of the session, and this
 * is what greets most of the ones that try.
 *
 * (The counts themselves are deliberately not written here. Field and user numbers live only in the
 * gitignored analysis directory, never in code, docs, changelog or commit messages.)
 *
 * The daemon can tell these three cases apart, and they have completely different next actions:
 *   - nothing is listening anywhere       -> the dev server is not running; start it
 *   - something is listening, never dialled -> the SDK is not wired into that app; run `reticle init`
 *   - a session was connected and went away -> the tab closed or reloaded; reopen/reload it
 *
 * Today all three produce the same dead end.

 * reach. It was named in three branches and missing from the two an agent that has NEVER connected
 * actually lands on, which are precisely the branches where it is the only way out.
 *
 * Reported from Windows, where the MCP server was registered and all its tools advertised while no
 * CLI existed on disk: every remedy offered was a shell command the agent could not run. Also from
 * two reporters whose daemon was pinned to a different repo, who were told to restart it and had no
 * in-session alternative.
 *
 * Asserted over every branch, because the value of an escape hatch is that it is there on the path
 * you are actually on.
