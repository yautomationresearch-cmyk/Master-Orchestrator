/**
 * The daemon decides "has this project been through `reticle init`" ONCE, at boot — and the ordinary
 * first-install order is the other way round: the daemon is already up (something started it), then
 * `init` writes `.reticle.json`, then the app is wired. Reported from the field: `reticle status`
 * answered "this project has not been through `reticle init`" while the config file sat there with a
 * framework and a projectId in it and the Vite plugin was wired. The real cause was a dev server
 * started before the plugin existed — and the one sentence the reader was most likely to act on sent
 * them to re-run an install that was already done.
 *
 * The projectPort read in this file already carries this reasoning ("`.reticle.json` can be written
 * by init after this daemon started"); `initialized` simply never got it.
