/**
 * Turn a bare command timeout into something the reader can act on.
 *
 * The default message — `command 'snapshot' timed out after 8000ms` — is eight seconds of silence
 * followed by a fact with no cause. For a Tauri app the cause is usually not a bug in the app: its
 * window was hidden before the webview had ever been PRESENTED, and a webview that has never been
 * presented never loads its page. The session stays connected, so nothing looks wrong, and the
 * developer goes hunting through their own code for a fault that is not there.
 *
 * This advice previously blamed occlusion — "macOS suspends an occluded or off-Space WKWebView" —
 * which is false, and was the kind of wrong steer this function exists to prevent. A LOADED Tauri
 * webview keeps answering while minimized, app-hidden, occluded, and on another Space.
 *
 * It then over-corrected: it asserted the hidden-before-load ordering as FACT. But the only evidence
 * here is `hidden === true` — the ordering is never observed. Measured on a Tauri shell pointed at an
 * external http origin, whose window nothing ever hid: the message confidently prescribed a fix for a
 * mistake that had not been made, and two rounds of debugging went into the wrong place. A diagnostic
 * that names the wrong cause is worse than a bare timeout, because the bare timeout at least sends
 * the reader looking. So this now reports what is KNOWN and ranks the causes rather than picking one.
 *
 * The advice is ADDED, never substituted — the original fact still leads — and only for a runtime
 * that can actually suffer it, since misdirecting an Electron user costs them the same hour.
