/**
 * Whether a session was attached for the whole window an agent is about to reason about.
 *
 * `reticle_sessions` answers "which tabs are connected RIGHT NOW", and **a tab that dropped for four
 * seconds and came back looks identical to one that never dropped** (#117). That is the difference
 * between a verdict you can trust and one that describes what you happened to see — the same problem
 * `honesty.integrity` solves for a single action, applied to the session.
 *
 * Measured HERE rather than reported by the SDK. The browser transport does track
 * `#disconnectedSince` (`transport.ts:95`), and reading it would need a wire change and a new thing
 * for every SDK version to remember to send. The daemon already sees both halves — `remove()` when
 * the socket drops, `add()` when it returns — so the gap is computable with no protocol change at
 * all, and it cannot drift out of sync with what the daemon actually observed.
 *
 * The clock is injected, per the repo rule: this is arithmetic over timestamps, and a test that
 * needs to wait four seconds to check a four-second gap is a test nobody runs.
