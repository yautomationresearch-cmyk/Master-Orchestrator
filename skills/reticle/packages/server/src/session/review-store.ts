 * again at `m1`, so an id an agent was still holding silently came to denote a DIFFERENT mark — and
 * `resolve` retired that one instead, reporting success. Reported from the field by an agent that
 * closed a bug nobody had fixed while the two it had fixed vanished unrecorded.
 *
 * Process-wide is deliberately not "forever": a daemon restart resets it, but a restart also
 * destroys every session, so any id from before it resolves to nothing and `resolve` correctly
 * returns false. The identity echo below covers what remains.
