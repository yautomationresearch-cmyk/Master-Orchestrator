 * Turning "no browser session connected" from a dead end into a next action.
 *
 * This is the most consequential sentence in the product. Most sessions never call a Reticle tool at
 * all, and of the ones that do, a large share make exactly ONE call — usually `reticle_sessions` —
 * and stop. Almost none of those ever touched a browser, and this is the session error they hit. The
 * agent asks whether anything is connected, is told no, and leaves.
 *
 * The old message asked the agent to check two things it cannot see from where it stands ("is your
 * app running with the SDK enabled?", "does it point at this port?"). The daemon can actually tell
 * the three cases apart, and each has a different, concrete fix:
 *
 *   - a session was here and went away    -> the tab closed or reloaded; reopen it
 *   - something is listening, never dialled, project not wired -> run `reticle init` in THAT app
 *   - something is listening, project wired -> port mismatch or a stale build; restart the dev server
 *   - nothing is listening anywhere       -> there is no app running; start it
 *
 * Pure: everything it needs is passed in, so the probe that discovers listening ports stays out of
 * the hot resolve() path and this stays unit-testable.
