/**
 * Aggregate many crawl runs into the one number the core claim needs.
 *
 * Detection already exists: `reticle_crawl` drives every reachable control and reports contradictions
 * — two channels disagreeing about the same click. It found `swallowed-500-login` and, separately,
 * `ui-advanced-request-failed` on a control whose assertion was green, neither of them planted.
 *
 * What was missing is the arithmetic that turns those into evidence. The claim worth making is not
 * "Reticle can find bugs"; it is:
 *
 *   "Run over N already-merged, already-green changes, it found X real bugs their own tests
 *    certified as passing."
 *
 * That needs no control arm, which is why it is the cheapest credible proof available: the
 * counterfactual is already established, because those changes SHIPPED. An A/B is the second study,
 * and this tells you where to point it.
 *
 * Pure functions over already-collected reports — the driving is `reticle_crawl`'s job, and running
 * it across a commit range is a shell loop. This is only the part that must not be done by eye.
