 * BrowserPool — one headless browser, many cheap isolated contexts.
 *
 * The "10 agents test 10 flows" scenario does NOT mean 10 Chromiums (each ~hundreds of MB). It means
 * ONE launched browser and N `newContext` calls (each ~a few MB, fully isolated cookies/storage).
 * The pool owns that single browser, hands out per-flow leases, caps concurrency so a machine is
 * never overwhelmed (over-cap acquires queue FIFO), and transparently relaunches if the browser dies.
 *
 * The browser is injected via a `Launcher` so all lifecycle logic is testable without real Chromium;
 * the thin Playwright adapter that satisfies these interfaces lives separately.
