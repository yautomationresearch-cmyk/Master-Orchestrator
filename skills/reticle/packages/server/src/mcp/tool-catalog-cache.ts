/**
 * The tool catalog the proxy has already seen, so a locally-answered handshake is not toolless.
 *
 * When the daemon does not answer in time the proxy answers `initialize` itself — a hang gives the
 * agent no tools AND no diagnosis, so that is right. But it left the client CONNECTED WITH NO TOOLS,
 * because `tools/list` then had nothing behind it. Measured over one editor session: 25 stream drops,
 * 11 dormant, 4 reconnects, 4 local handshakes — and each of those four is a state where a human has
 * to notice and reconnect by hand.
 *
 * Every `tools/list` response the daemon has ever sent passes through this proxy, so the catalog is
 * already in hand. Serving it back is the difference between "Reticle is here but useless" and
 * "Reticle is here, and the first call will tell you what is wrong".
 *
 * In-memory and per-process on purpose: a catalog persisted from a different Reticle version would be
 * its own confidently-wrong answer, and a proxy that has never seen one has nothing honest to serve —
 * so it says nothing rather than inventing a list the agent would then call into.
