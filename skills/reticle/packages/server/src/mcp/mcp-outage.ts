/**
 * Reporting that the agent lost its Reticle tools.
 *
 * The proxy already writes a full account of an outage to ~/.reticle/mcp-proxy.log, which is exactly
 * where nobody looks and nothing aggregates. So the one question the transport must answer — how
 * often does a real user's MCP server go down, and does it come back — had no answer outside the
 * machine it happened on.
 *
 * Capped at two events per proxy process, and the cap is the design rather than a limitation. One
 * measured afternoon produced 547 proxy reconnects; an event per reconnect would bill for the
 * pathology instead of measuring it, which is the same mistake the per-call `tool` event made before
 * it was removed. What a dashboard needs is the SHARE OF SESSIONS that lose MCP at all (the first
 * outage) and the share where it never came back on its own (the budget being spent).
