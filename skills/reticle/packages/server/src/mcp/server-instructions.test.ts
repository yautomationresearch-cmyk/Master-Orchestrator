 * It used to open on tool grammar, which is the right thing to say to an agent that has an app to
 * point the tools at and the wrong thing to say to one that does not. The overwhelming majority of
 * daemons in the field never see an app connect, never run a command and never call a tool: the
 * step being missed is not a hard one, it is one nobody was ever asked to take.
