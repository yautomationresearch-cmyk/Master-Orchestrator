/**
 * Answer `initialize` when the daemon cannot.
 *
 * The proxy queues every client message until the daemon's SSE endpoint frame arrives. `initialize`
 * is a client message, so when the daemon port is held by something that accepts connections and
 * never serves SSE — a wedged daemon, a foreign process, a daemon leaked by another project — the
 * handshake waits on a thing that is never coming. Reported from the field as "initialize never
 * answers, no tools run at all"; reproduced with a listener that simply never responds.
 *
 * A hang is the worst possible outcome here: no tools, no diagnosis, nothing to retry. Completing
 * the handshake locally gives the agent a working surface whose FIRST tool call reports the real
 * problem through the no-session diagnostics that already exist.
 *
 * Safe because the proxy replays the client's own `initialize` to the daemon whenever a session is
 * finally established (see `replayLines`), so the daemon still gets its handshake in order.
