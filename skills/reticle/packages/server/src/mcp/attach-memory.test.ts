/**
 * "Registered" and "usable" are two different states, and `status` could only report one of them.
 *
 * Some MCP hosts register the Reticle server, start it, and never send `tools/list` until the client
 * is restarted. From our side that user is indistinguishable from somebody who installed Reticle and
 * lost interest; from theirs, Reticle is a tool that does nothing and says nothing about why.
 *
 * Two durable bits tell those apart, and both are records of something that HAPPENED rather than an
 * inference: a client started the MCP server on this port, and a client asked it for the tool list.
 * These tests pin the three states those bits produce, and pin that the healthy one stays silent —
 * advice printed beside a working install reads as though something is wrong.
