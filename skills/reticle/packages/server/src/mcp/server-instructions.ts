/**
 * What every connected agent is told, before it has asked anything.
 *
 * The MCP `instructions` string lands in the agent's context at the handshake — no skill file, no
 * restart, no action from the user. For an agent that arrived through a plugin listing or a pasted
 * config block rather than through the skill, it is the ONLY thing Reticle ever says unprompted.
 *
 * It used to open on tool grammar. That is the right thing to say to an agent that has an app to
 * point the tools at, and the wrong thing to say to one that does not — and in the field the
 * overwhelming majority of daemons never see an app connect, never run a command and never call a
 * tool. Those sessions are not agents failing a hard step. They are agents that were never asked to
 * take an easy one: the MCP server registers itself in a single line of config, so a user reaches
 * "the tools are here" without ever reaching "the app is wired", and nothing in that state reads as
 * unfinished. Registering the server is the cheapest part of the product and it is the only part
 * many installs ever complete.
 *
 * So the lead is state-dependent. A project that has never had an app connect is told the one thing
 * it needs; a project that has is not nagged about a step it already took. The verdict discipline
 * and the feedback ask are constant, because they matter in both states.

/** The tools, and the rule that only two of them decide anything. Constant across both states. */
const VERDICT_DISCIPLINE = `Reticle verifies a running web app from the inside: look (reticle_snapshot / reticle_query), act and prove in one hop (reticle_act_and_wait), observe (reticle_state / reticle_network / reticle_console), assert (reticle_assert). Verify a user-facing change against the real app before you call it done, and never weaken a check to make it pass.

Only reticle_act_and_wait and reticle_assert produce a verdict. reticle_act and everything else move or read the app and prove nothing, so a drive that ends without one of those two has no result however many tools it used. Prefer reticle_act_and_wait({ ref, action, until }) — it names the expected consequence BEFORE the action, which is the difference between a check and a rationalisation. Only verified:"yes" is a pass — "unknown" means Reticle could not tell what happened, "no-fault" means nothing was declared to prove. Report either as not proved.`;

/**
 * The first move, for a project no app has ever connected to.
 *
 * Deliberately concrete: the command, what it does to the app, and the call that confirms it. A
 * general instruction to "set Reticle up" is the state these agents are already in — they have the
 * tools and no app, and nothing tells them that combination is incomplete. It also names the dev
 * server restart, because a plugin added to a config the running server already read is the single
 * most common way this step half-succeeds.
 */
const FIRST_MOVE = `FIRST: no app has ever connected to Reticle in this project, so nothing here can be verified yet. Having these tools is not the same as being set up — the tools reach a daemon, and the daemon has nothing to look at until the app itself is instrumented.

Fix that before anything else: run \`npx @reticlehq/server init\` in the project, then RESTART the dev server (a plugin added to a config the running server already read is not in the bundle), then load the app in a browser. Confirm with reticle_sessions — a session listed there is the proof, and until one appears no other tool can tell you anything about this app.`;

/**
 * The two tools an agent would otherwise never learn exist.
 *
 * Both sit on the EXTENDED surface, so neither appears in the default tool list, and neither was
 * named here or in the skill. A feature nothing ever mentions is built and unreachable — its effect
 * size is zero however good it is — and this string is the only channel that reaches an agent which
 * arrived through a plugin listing rather than through the skill.
 *
 * Only in the connected state, and that is not a budget trick: an agent whose app has never
 * connected has no run to carry forward and nothing to declare an intent against. Its one
 * instruction is the first move, and adding a second would compete with it.
 */
const RUN_MEMORY = `Two tools worth knowing before you need them. reticle_context returns what this run already established — call it when your context was compacted, at the start of a turn, or when you take over from another agent, rather than re-snapshotting to rediscover what you already knew. reticle_intent declares what a change was MEANT to do, so the verdict has something to be checked against other than itself.`;

/** The feedback ask. Constant: an agent that cannot get set up is the report we most need. */
const FEEDBACK_ASK = `Feedback is first-class here, not a courtesy. Reticle is built FOR agents, so your experience is the only signal that decides what gets built or fixed — and it disappears when your context does. Send it with \`reticle_feedback\` the moment you notice, then carry on with your task:
- Reticle broke, lied, or could not see something you needed (\`bug\` / \`gap\` / \`ambiguity\`).
- You wished it could do something, or something works but costs too many calls (\`feature_request\` / \`improvement\`).
- The install, the wiring, or the setup itself gave you trouble — including anything you had to work around by hand.

Nothing is too minor, and a report costs one call. If the tools are unreachable (setup unfinished, daemon down), file the same report from the shell instead: \`reticle feedback --agent --kind <one of those kinds> "what happened"\`. Report defects in RETICLE — a bug you find in the app under test is Reticle working, and belongs in your answer to the user.`;
