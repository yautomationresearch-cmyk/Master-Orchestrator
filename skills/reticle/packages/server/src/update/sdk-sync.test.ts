/**
 * `reticle update` updated the DAEMON and left the app's SDK where it was.
 *
 * That is the exact pairing the whole version-skew apparatus exists to warn about, produced by the
 * command whose job is to prevent it. Worse, the skew message told people to fix an outdated SDK by
 * running `reticle update` — advice that could not work, because that command never touched the
 * app's packages. One half of the product updated, the other half was told it had.
 *
 * These pin the missing half: which packages belong to Reticle, and what a pinned sync of them looks
 * like. The pin matters for the same reason `init` pins — an unpinned `add` can resolve to a stale
 * registry cache and reinstall the very skew being fixed.
