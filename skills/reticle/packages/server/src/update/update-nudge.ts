/**
 * Telling the agent that a newer Reticle exists.
 *
 * Until now nothing did. `checkForUpdate` had exactly one caller — the `reticle update` command — so
 * a published release was invisible to every install until a human happened to type that command,
 * which in practice meant never. A fix could ship and sit unused for months on the machines that hit
 * the bug it fixed.
 *
 * The nudge rides the tool-result envelope rather than being a tool of its own, for the same reason
 * the session-health and pool-lease reminders do: the agent is mid-task, and something it has to go
 * and ASK for is something it will not ask for. Delivered ONCE per daemon process — a repeated
 * "please update" during someone's work is noise, and noise is what gets filtered out.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT update anything by itself. A silent self-install would swap the binary
 * under a running session, restart the daemon, and drop every agent attached to it — during work the
 * human never agreed to interrupt. So the envelope carries the fact and the exact command, and the
 * decision stays with the people whose machine it is.
