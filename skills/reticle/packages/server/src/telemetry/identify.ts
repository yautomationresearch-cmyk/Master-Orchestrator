/**
 * `reticle identify` — the ONLY way Reticle ever learns who you are, and it is a thing you type.
 *
 * The product question behind this is real: which of these anonymous ids are companies who would pay
 * for support, an enterprise licence, or a design-partner slot? The tempting answer is to infer it —
 * match a git remote against a company domain, sniff an email out of `git config`, resolve an npm org.
 * Reticle does none of that, and the refusal is deliberate rather than squeamish:
 *
 *   - it would contradict a promise made in four places (README, usage, enterprise FAQ, telemetry
 *     policy) that project names, git remotes and account identifiers are never sent;
 *   - covert identification of a data subject is not "anonymous usage metrics", so it would also
 *     break the legal basis the policy states — legitimate interest, minimized to the listed fields;
 *   - and it is worse at the actual job. A scraped lead is a cold email from a tool the recipient
 *     trusted, which is the fastest way to turn an advocate into someone who runs
 *     `reticle telemetry disable` and tells their team to do the same. A self-identified one already
 *     wants to talk to you.
 *
 * So this is opt-in, explicit, reversible, and it tells the user exactly what it links before it
 * sends anything.
