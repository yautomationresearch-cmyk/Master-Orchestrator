/**
 * Record telemetry to a local file instead of sending it anywhere.
 *
 * Two problems it solves at once, and they pull in the same direction:
 *
 *   1. A release sweep drives dozens of real sessions. Every one of those emits `daemon_started`,
 *      `verification_completed`, `bug_found` — indistinguishable, in PostHog, from a user. Test runs
 *      polluting the numbers is the same class of error as counting `cli_command_run { mcp }` as
 *      human intent: the metric stops describing what it claims to.
 *   2. Verifying telemetry has meant standing up an HTTP capture server by hand, every time. Ad-hoc
 *      harnesses are how a check ends up measuring nothing — the two traps already written down are
 *      that telemetry is disabled inside a Reticle checkout, and that a schema addition with no
 *      contract entry passes silently.
 *
 * A file is the whole design. `RETICLE_TELEMETRY_FILE=<path>` writes one JSON object per line and
 * sends NOTHING. It is the same payload that would have gone on the wire — built by the same code
 * path, redacted by the same rules — so what a run records is what a user would have sent.
