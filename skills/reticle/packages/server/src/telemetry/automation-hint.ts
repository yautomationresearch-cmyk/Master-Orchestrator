/**
 * An ADVISORY marker that a run looks automated, for the runs `ci` cannot see.
 *
 * `ci` is a single environment variable, which is exactly right for a GitHub Actions runner and
 * blind to everything else: our own gate has run from a datacenter and landed in the user data
 * indistinguishable from somebody at a laptop.
 *
 * ADVISORY, and never a filter. A real person works inside a container, inside a Codespace, and over
 * an ssh session with no terminal attached, and every one of them is a user. Nothing may drop a row
 * because this is set; it exists so a surprising number can be looked at from a second angle, and a
 * hint that starts being used as an exclusion has stopped being a hint. Absent means "nothing here
 * looked automated", never "a human was present".
 *
 * WHAT WAS REJECTED, so nobody re-proposes it:
 *  - IP address, ASN or datacenter geolocation. Not knowable client-side, and it is a stronger
 *    identifier than anything else we collect. The one signal that would actually separate a cloud
 *    sandbox from a laptop is the one we will not collect.
 *  - Hostname patterns (`runner-*`, `ip-10-*`). A hostname is user data, and matching names is
 *    guesswork dressed as a measurement — a guessed dimension and a measured one are
 *    indistinguishable once they are in the same column.
 *  - Process ancestry. Costs a spawn on a path that must never tax a command, and reads the name of
 *    somebody else's program to classify our own user.
 *  - `npm_config_user_agent`. Says which package manager ran us, which every route shares.
 *  - An absent `$DISPLAY`. Every Linux server, every ssh session, and a large share of genuine
 *    developer machines trip it; it separates nothing.
