/**
 * The stack must be detectable when the app is not in the daemon's own directory.
 *
 * `detectStack` read exactly `join(cwd, 'package.json')` and gave up. The daemon's cwd is whatever
 * the agent's client happened to launch in — usually the repo root, while the app lives in
 * `frontend/`, `web/` or a declared workspace.
 *
 * The finding that forced the fix: across every project where Reticle was demonstrably SET UP
 * (flows / contract / features present), the stack was detected on NONE of them — and on none of
 * the large repos either. The bigger and more real the repo, the more certainly we failed. That is
 * not "these are not web apps"; Reticle only works on web apps. It is a detector looking in one
 * directory.
