/**
 * Three defects in the session-summary path, all measured against the exported PostHog data
 * (`plan/export-2026-08-07-205221.csv`, 1,468 events, one day).
 *
 * 1. AN EVENT NAMED `daemon_stopped` IS EMITTED WHILE THE DAEMON IS RUNNING.
 *    The 30-minute periodic flush emits `DAEMON_STOPPED` with `final: false`. In the export, 98
 *    `daemon_stopped` events are 73 real exits + 25 mid-session flushes. Counting them as sessions
 *    over-states by 34%, and the two populations are OPPOSITES: every one of the 25 flushes had
 *    tool calls, and not one of the 73 exits did. Any funnel drawn over the raw event is not
 *    slightly off, it is describing a different thing at each end. (Our own funnel analysis made
 *    exactly this mistake.)
 *
 * 2. `#seenBugKinds` IS CLEARED BY THE FLUSH.
 *    It is not a window counter — it is the session-lifetime memory that decides `repeat` on
 *    `bug_found`. Clearing it every 30 minutes makes the same defect, found again, report as a new
 *    distinct one. Sessions in the export run to 11.5 hours, i.e. 23 chances to double-count.
 *
 * 3. THE LAST WINDOW OF AN ACTIVE DAEMON IS NEVER REPORTED.
 *    A daemon that served a tool never idle-exits (correctly — it is doing a job), and nothing else
 *    calls shutdown, so its final partial window dies with the process. Measured: 0 of 73 final
 *    summaries carry a single tool call; all 400 tool calls, 13 bugs and 2 verifications in the
 *    dataset arrived via flushes. The unreported tail is bounded by the flush interval, which is why
 *    a 30-minute interval is the wrong bound for a median 28-minute session.
