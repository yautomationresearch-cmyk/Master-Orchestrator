/**
 * A durable outbox for feedback, written BEFORE the network is touched.
 *
 * Feedback is the only qualitative channel this product has, and it carries an agent's whole
 * root-cause analysis — often an hour of driving distilled into one payload. It was sent with the
 * same 2-second fire-and-forget budget as a usage counter, with no retry and no persistence, so a
 * 1.3-second network hiccup destroyed the report outright. Measured to the collector from one
 * machine with a WARM DNS cache: dns 0.003s, connect 0.233s, tls 0.467s, total 0.694s — roughly a
 * third of the entire budget spent before a byte of payload moves, and that is the good case. A
 * fresh short-lived CLI process pays cold DNS and a cold route on top.
 *
 * So the order is inverted: write it down first, then try to send. A failed send is then a queued
 * report rather than a lost one, and `sent: false` becomes a statement about the network instead of
 * an epitaph.
 *
 * JSONL, appended, one payload per line. Append-only is the point — a crash mid-write costs at most
 * the line being written, never the ones already there.
