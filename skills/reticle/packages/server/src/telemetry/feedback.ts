/**
 * The feedback channel — the one place in Reticle that sends words someone wrote.
 *
 * Reticle is built for agents, and until now nothing closed the loop: when a tool misbehaved, or a
 * verification came back undecidable, or an observer simply could not see the thing that mattered,
 * that knowledge died in the agent's context window. This module is the return path. An agent files a
 * report through `reticle_feedback` when a tool fails it; a human files one through `reticle
 * feedback` with a rating and their own words.
 *
 * Three properties are non-negotiable here, because free text is a different privacy class from the
 * event counters the rest of telemetry sends:
 *
 *   1. NEVER PASSIVE. There is no code path that emits feedback on its own. Every event is the direct
 *      result of an explicit call someone made carrying content they authored. Nothing is scraped
 *      from the app, the DOM, the network log, or the repo.
 *   2. REDACTED BEFORE THE WIRE. `redactFeedbackText` strips the credential/PII shapes that leak into
 *      a pasted trace even when the author meant no harm. It runs client-side, so the redaction is
 *      auditable in this repo rather than promised in a policy.
 *   3. INDEPENDENTLY DISABLE-ABLE. `RETICLE_FEEDBACK=0` kills the channel while leaving anonymous
 *      adoption metrics on — the setting an org wants when counters are fine but prose is not. Every
 *      existing switch (`RETICLE_TELEMETRY=0`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, `reticle telemetry disable`) still
 *      disables it too, since it rides the same emitter.
