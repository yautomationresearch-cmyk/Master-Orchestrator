/**
 * Anonymous adoption telemetry — the OSS runtime's ONLY phone-home for product metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU,
 * invocations, sessions, installs, tool usage). It answers the "npm downloads don't count, show me
 * platform usage" question without collecting anything personal:
 *
 *   - identity is a random UUID minted locally at `~/.reticle/telemetry-id` (never derived from you),
 *   - the project is a one-way HASH of the cwd (counts DISTINCT projects, reveals none),
 *   - it is strictly opt-OUT: `RETICLE_TELEMETRY=0` or the `DO_NOT_TRACK` convention disables it,
 *   - it is best-effort and non-blocking: a send failure NEVER changes what the tool does.
 *
 * Events are `@reticlehq/core`'s `TelemetryEventSchema`, mapped at the wire into PostHog's capture
 * format (https://posthog.com/docs/api/capture) — PostHog is the analytics backend until Reticle Cloud
 * grows its own; a project API key is WRITE-ONLY by design, so embedding it in an OSS client is safe.
 * Everything here is wrapped so a telemetry bug can never surface to a user — a broken metric must not
 * break a verification.
