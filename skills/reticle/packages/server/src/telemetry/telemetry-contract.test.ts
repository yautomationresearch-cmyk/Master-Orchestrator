/**
 * THE TELEMETRY CONTRACT, enforced.
 *
 * Telemetry fails silently. Nothing throws when an event is missed, no test goes red, no user
 * complains — the data is simply, permanently absent, and you find out months later when someone
 * asks a question the data cannot answer. That makes it the one subsystem where "remember to
 * instrument it" is not a workable rule, and where the guard has to live in a test rather than in a
 * reviewer's head.
 *
 * Everything here is written so that ADDING something makes it fail. A new tool, a new event kind, a
 * new contradiction kind, a new finding source — each trips a check that names what is now missing
 * and where to add it. That is the point: these are not tests of what the code does today, they are
 * a tripwire on the ways the telemetry can silently stop being true.
 *
 * See `docs/telemetry-contract.md` for the human-facing version of these rules.
