/**
 * Which results count as a completed verification — and the two ways this was wrong.
 *
 * `flow_verify` reports `status: pass | fail | unverifiable`; `assert` reports a boolean `pass`. The
 * reader accepted `status === 'pass'` and mapped everything else to `undefined`, which produced two
 * opposite errors at once:
 *
 *   1. A FAILING suite emitted NOTHING. `verification_completed` only ever fired on a green, so the
 *      denominator was systematically biased — and a CI `verify` that went red, the single most
 *      valuable event the product can produce, was invisible. Meanwhile `bugsInResult` DID fire on
 *      `status: 'fail'`, so the data shows bugs with no verification to divide them by. That is
 *      precisely the shape of "80 daily actives and almost no verifications".
 *
 *   2. An EMPTY suite emitted `verified: "yes", passed: true`. Found by the adversarial MCP sweep:
 *      `reticle_flow_verify {}` on a project with no flows returned "all 0 flows pass" and counted
 *      itself as a passing verification. Nothing was verified.
