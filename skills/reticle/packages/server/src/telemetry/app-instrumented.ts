/**
 * When an app carrying the SDK first reaches this daemon.
 *
 * This is the step the whole funnel turns on, and the one nothing could measure. Registering the MCP
 * server and instrumenting an app are separate acts, done by different commands, and the data says
 * almost everybody does the first and almost nobody does the second — but proving that required
 * inferring it from a window counter that resets on every flush, and which therefore reported fewer
 * instrumented users than there were users calling tools.
 *
 * Once per daemon run, on the FIRST app connect only. A page that reloads, or an app that opens five
 * tabs, must not read as five instrumented installs — the question is "did this install ever get an
 * app wired", and it has one answer per run.
 *
 * Names, never values: whether `init` had been run and whether an agent was attached — never the
 * project path, the URL, or anything from the page. The stack is deliberately NOT repeated here;
 * `project_profiled` already carries it on the same daemon run, so the two join on sessionId.
