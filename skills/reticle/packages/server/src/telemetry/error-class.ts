/**
 * Whose defect was that tool error?
 *
 * `toolErrors` was one number covering three failures with three different fixes, so the top-line
 * count could be acted on only by unpacking `errors[]` by hand and reading the prose. Measured over
 * 2026-08-10/11: 60 `state`, 22 `refusal`, 20 `schema` (serialized zod arrays) and 20 stale refs.
 * Read as "126 tool errors" that hides the sixth of them where OUR schema failed to explain itself —
 * which is the only bucket we can fix by writing better descriptions.
 *
 * Classified from the message SHAPE, never stored raw: this returns a bucket, and the caller keeps
 * counts. The full message is already fingerprinted and skeletonised elsewhere.
