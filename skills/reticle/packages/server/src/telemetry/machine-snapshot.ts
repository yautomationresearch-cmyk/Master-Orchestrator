/**
 * What the machine looked like at a moment worth remembering.
 *
 * "Out of memory" and "our bug" produce identical-looking stack traces and are completely different
 * problems — one is a docs/limits issue on the user's side, the other is ours to fix. Without this,
 * every crash report arrived with that ambiguity baked in and no way to resolve it after the fact.
 *
 * Sampled at MOMENTS — a crash, the end of a session — never per tool call. `os.loadavg()` and
 * `process.memoryUsage()` are cheap but not free, and taking them two hundred times a session to
 * answer a question only ever asked about the bad moments would be a continuous cost for an
 * occasional need.
 *
 * Nothing here describes the person: it is our own process's footprint plus coarse machine capacity.
 * No hostname, no username, no disk paths, no process list.
