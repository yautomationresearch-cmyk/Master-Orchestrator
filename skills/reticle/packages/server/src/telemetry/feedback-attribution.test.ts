/**
 * Feedback must be stamped with the project it came FROM, not with whatever directory the daemon
 * happens to have been started in.
 *
 * Reported from the field: a report filed from an astro session arrived stamped
 * `"stack":"sveltekit"`. One daemon was serving several fixtures, `detectStack` read its cwd, and
 * the sessionId the caller passed was ignored for attribution entirely. Every report from a
 * multi-app machine is filed against the wrong framework, which is worse than filing none: it is
 * evidence pointing at an innocent stack.
