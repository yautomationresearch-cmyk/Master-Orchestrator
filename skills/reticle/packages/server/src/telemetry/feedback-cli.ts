/**
 * `reticle feedback [--rating 1-5] [--bug] "what happened"` — the feedback channel as a command.
 *
 * Kept to a single command with no prompts, no editor, and no account: the cost of telling us
 * something has to be lower than the cost of shrugging and moving on, or we only ever hear from people
 * angry enough to open an issue. A bare rating is a valid report; the words are optional garnish.
 *
 * `--agent --kind <…>` is the same channel for an AGENT that cannot reach `reticle_feedback` — during
 * `init`, while instrumentation is half-wired, or when the daemon will not start. Those are the
 * reports we are least likely to hear and most need: every other path we have requires the tool
 * surface to already work, so a Reticle that fails before it is running fails silently by design.
 *
 * What is sent is PRINTED before it goes, every time. A channel that carries free text and does not
 * show you the payload is asking for trust it has not earned.
