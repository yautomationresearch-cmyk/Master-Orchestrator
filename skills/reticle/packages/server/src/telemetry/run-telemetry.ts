/**
 * Telemetry for the verification RUNNER — the path `reticle verify` and the HTTP verify surface take.
 *
 * This path does not go through `runTool`, so for a while it produced nothing at all: no timing, no
 * `verification_completed`, and — worst — no `bug_found`. Which meant every defect Reticle caught in
 * CI was invisible to the one number we intend to publish, on precisely the surface most likely to
 * run at scale and unattended. A metric that is blind to CI is not measuring the product.
 *
 * Reported from the assembled run rather than from inside the replay loop: the run artifact is the
 * finished, already-classified verdict, so this cannot double-count and does not need to understand
 * how a replay works.
