/**
 * What a crash was, when the stack cannot say where it was.
 *
 * `reticleFrames` keeps only frames inside our own published packages, on the rule that a crash
 * stack is mostly the user's application and node internals and neither is ours to collect. That
 * rule is right and stays. But a refused socket has a stack that is ENTIRELY node internals:
 *
 *     Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4400
 *         at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (node:net:1637:16)
 *
 * so every crash of that shape arrives with an error type, a redacted message, and nothing else —
 * 65 of them in one measured day, one fingerprint, zero location on all 65, and 63 of those from
 * two people who emitted no other event of any kind. A loopback-heavy tool produces plenty of
 * these, and the next one is just as blind.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from a Node SYSTEM ERROR's own structured properties, and every field
 * is chosen so that it carries nothing of the reporter's: the syscall and errno are our own
 * vocabulary, `loopback` is one bit, the port is compared against values we already know and
 * reported as an enum, and the frame names a line in NODE's source. The address and the port number
 * are read and deliberately thrown away.
