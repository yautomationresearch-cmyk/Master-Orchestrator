/**
 * Classifying WHY a browser connection failed, into causes that each have a different fix.
 *
 * A raw error message cannot be sent — it carries CDP URLs, executable paths, and home directories —
 * and would be useless if it could, because the same cause arrives worded five different ways from
 * Playwright, Node and the OS. What we need is the small set of THINGS THAT ACTUALLY GO WRONG:
 * a missing browser binary is a docs problem, a refused CDP endpoint is a configuration problem, a
 * pool timeout is a capacity problem. Three very different responses from us.
 *
 * `OTHER` is the bucket to watch. A large `OTHER` count means the classifier has a blind spot and
 * this list needs another entry — which is a signal in itself, and the reason it is never merged
 * into one of the known causes.
