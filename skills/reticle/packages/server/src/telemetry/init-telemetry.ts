/**
 * How `reticle init` went.
 *
 * The onboarding funnel had no instrumentation at all, which meant the two most different failure
 * modes were indistinguishable: someone whose setup died on a missing dependency looked exactly like
 * someone who installed the package and never ran the command. One is a bug we can fix; the other is
 * a marketing problem. Both showed up as silence.
 *
 * `reticle init` runs as a one-shot CLI command that exits immediately, so the send is DETACHED — the
 * same treatment `cli_command_run` gets, for the same reason: an in-process fetch would keep the
 * event loop alive and tax the command by most of a second.
