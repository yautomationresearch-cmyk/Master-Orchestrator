/**
 * The in-process session accumulator — the reason Reticle's telemetry bill does not scale with how
 * hard people use it.
 *
 * The old design emitted one event per MCP tool call. That reads as harmless until you multiply it
 * out: a single agent verification loop is 50–200 tool calls, so a thousand daily users would push
 * millions of events a day, and PostHog bills per ingested event. Worse, it was millions of events
 * answering a question that ONE property answers better — `{reticle_act: 40, reticle_assert: 12}`
 * tells you the session was a real verification loop, where 52 separate rows tell you only that 52
 * things happened, with the shape scattered across them.
 *
 * So counts live here, in memory, and leave as a single `daemon_stopped` event.
 *
 * Everything recorded is a COUNT or a fingerprint. No tool arguments, no results, no selectors, no
 * URLs, no error messages — the accumulator has no way to hold them, which is a stronger guarantee
 * than a rule saying it shouldn't.
