/**
 * Report that a person ran a `reticle` subcommand.

 * `_daemon` is EXCLUDED, and that exclusion is the whole point of this function. `reticle mcp` and
 * `reticle serve` start the daemon by re-running this very binary, so the child re-entered the CLI
 * entry point and emitted a second event for what a person experienced as ONE action. The old
 * `invoke` metric was therefore inflated ~2x — and inflated worst on the agent-driven sessions that
 * matter most, while one-shot commands like `version` counted once. That skewed the RATIO between
 * commands, not merely the scale, which is the kind of error you cannot correct for after the fact.
 * The daemon\'s own lifecycle is already reported by `daemon_started` / `daemon_stopped`; a spawned
 * daemon is not a CLI run.

 * events (85%), on an event whose whole purpose is human intent, and the agent attaching is already
 * reported by `mcp_client_connected` with strictly more detail (reconnect, daemon age, client).
