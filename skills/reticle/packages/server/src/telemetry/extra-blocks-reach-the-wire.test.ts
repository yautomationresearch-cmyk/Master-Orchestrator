/**
 * A declared telemetry block must actually reach the wire.
 *
 * Adding one means editing FOUR hand-maintained lists that nothing keeps in step: the core wire
 * schema, the event-building spread, the destructure, and the `blocks` prefix map. Miss any one and
 * the block is silently dropped — the event still fires, still validates, still arrives, and carries
 * none of the fields it exists to carry.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened to `app_instrumented` on its first day: the reporter was correct,
 * the unit test for it passed, the event landed at a real capture endpoint — with only the base
 * envelope on it. It was caught by connecting a real session to a real daemon and reading the
 * captured payload, because every layer in between was individually fine.
 *
 * So this asserts the property that actually matters and cannot be satisfied by a partial wiring:
 * for every optional block on the extra contract, emitting it produces `<block>_<field>` properties.
 * A new block with no wiring fails here rather than in six months' worth of missing data.
