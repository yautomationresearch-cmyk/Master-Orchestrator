/**
 * What we can honestly know about a project's git setup, read from `.git/` on disk.
 *
 * This exists to make three counting questions answerable and, just as importantly, to make it
 * visible when they are NOT answerable:
 *
 *   - how many users does one project have?  (distinct anonymousId per projectId)
 *   - how many projects does one user have?  (distinct projectId per anonymousId)
 *   - how many people work alone vs on a shared repo?
 *
 * All three depend on `projectId` meaning the same thing on two different machines, which is only
 * true when it was derived from a git ORIGIN. Outside a repo, or in a repo nobody has pushed, the
 * fingerprint falls back to a hash of the directory path — and two teammates on the same unpushed
 * project then look like two unrelated projects. That is not a bug we can fix (there is nothing
 * shared to hash), so instead every event reports WHICH source it used, and the analytics can filter
 * to the rows where "users per project" is a real number instead of quietly averaging in the ones
 * where it is always 1.
 *
 * Read from `.git/config` directly rather than by shelling out to `git`: this runs on the CLI's
 * startup path, where a ~30ms subprocess spawn would tax every single `reticle` command, and it must
 * work on a machine with no `git` binary installed at all.
