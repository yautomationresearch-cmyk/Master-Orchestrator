/**
 * A verdict must be decided by the channel the caller asked about.
 *
 * Both cases here were measured in the field on correct apps:
 *
 *  - an error path verified by declaring the failing request in the oracle — `{ net, POST,
 *    /api/v1/auth/login, status: 500 }` plus the right message present and the wrong one absent —
 *    came back "channels disagree (ui-advanced-request-failed)" every single run, so error handling
 *    was the one thing that could never reach a green verdict;
 *  - a navigation whose destination heading was FOUND, with its source file and line, was reported
 *    as `route-rendered-nothing` — a clause name the evidence beside it disproves.
 *
 * The negative controls are the point of the file: each fix has to leave the real false green it was
 * built for catchable, so every suppression here is paired with a case that must still fire.
