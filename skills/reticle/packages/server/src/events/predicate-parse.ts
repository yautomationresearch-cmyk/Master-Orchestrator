/**
 * One readable sentence when a predicate does not parse — never the zod array.
 *
 * In the field a meaningful share of all tool errors were **a serialized zod issue array**, all on
 * `reticle_act_and_wait`, `reticle_wait_for` and `reticle_assert` — the three tools that produced
 * every action-derived finding in the dataset. The least readable error we emit was landing on the
 * highest-value path, and an agent had to `JSON.parse` an error string to learn which field it got
 * wrong.
 *
 * `PredicateSchema.parse()` throws a `ZodError` whose `.message` IS that array, and three handlers
 * call it directly. This wraps it once, so every caller gets the same shape rather than each
 * growing its own catch — the pattern #108 asks for: name the parameter, say whether anything ran,
 * show a valid call.

 * the `element` shape wrong, was shown a `signal` example, got `element` wrong again, and was shown
 * the same `signal` example. A rejected predicate produces no verdict at all, so each of those was a
 * round trip that ended with nothing — and the one field an agent most needs (`element`'s nested
 * `query`) is exactly what a flat example cannot convey.
