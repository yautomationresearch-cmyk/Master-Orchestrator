/**
 * A consumer may add its own rule to the verdict, without editing the ones this package ships.
 *
 * Every rule here is a pure fold over a recording: events in, findings out, no session, no clock, no
 * IO. That is exactly the shape a service embedding this engine wants for rules of its own — and the
 * only thing standing between it and one was that `findContradictions` reads a fixed list of folds
 * written into the function body. Appending to that list means editing this file, which means a fork,
 * which means the consumer's rules and this package's own become one tree that has to be
 * merged forever.
 *
 * A registry rather than a parameter, because there are six call sites and none of them are reached
 * by the consumer: the tools call `findContradictions` internally, and a tool handler is handed a
 * deps bag, not options. Threading a parameter would mean touching every path a verdict can take and
 * would still miss the ones inside `crawl`. Registration is once, at boot, by whoever composed the
 * process.
