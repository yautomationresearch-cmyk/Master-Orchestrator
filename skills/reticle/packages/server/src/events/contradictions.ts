/**
 * The contradiction hunter.
 *
 * Every other check in Reticle reads ONE channel and asks "did something bad happen there?" — a
 * console error, a 500, a control that did nothing. A human can do that too, just slower.
 *
 * This asks a question a human structurally cannot: do the channels DISAGREE with each other? A
 * person watching an app has exactly one channel open — the screen. The agent holds the DOM, the
 * store, the app's own signals, the console and the network in one causally ordered window, so it
 * can catch the case where the screen says one thing and the network says the opposite.
 *
 * That gap is where false greens live. The archetype ships in both desktop demos: click Archive, the
 * row disappears, the status line reads "archived", and the IPC call rejected into a swallowed
 * `.catch()`. A screenshot agrees. A DOM assertion agrees. A human agrees. Only the disagreement
 * between channels reveals it.
 *
 * Pure: a window of events in, findings out. No session, no IO, no clock.
