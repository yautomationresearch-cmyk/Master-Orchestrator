/**
 * Asserting on a response BODY, because a status code cannot see the worst false green there is.
 *
 * Found by an agent driving a real payments UI, and its report is the clearest statement of the
 * problem: a refund posted `{"amount":"1187.01"}`, the server answered 200 with
 * `{"ok":true,"refunded":11.87}` after reading the number as paise, and the page rendered the amount
 * the user had typed rather than the amount that came back. Every channel that could be asserted was
 * green - the request fired, exactly once, status 200, console clean, page settled - so
 * `act_and_wait` returned `verified: "yes"` on a hundred-fold wrong money operation.
 *
 * The truth was in the captured body, and the only way to reach it was `reticle_network` read by eye,
 * which produces no verdict. In the reporter's words: the comparison that actually matters happened
 * in its head, not in Reticle, so it was neither verifiable nor repeatable. A predicate that can name
 * a value inside the body is what turns that into a pass or a fail.
