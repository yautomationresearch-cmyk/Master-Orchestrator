/**
 * A write that returned OK and quietly did not apply part of what it was asked to.
 *
 * Measured on a desktop preferences write: the request asked for `{density:'compact', locale:'fr'}`,
 * the response echoed `{"ok":true,"saved":{"density":"compact","locale":"en"}}`, the UI said
 * "Preferences saved", and every channel agreed. `locale` was silently discarded. Nothing above the
 * payload can see this — the status is 200, the body reports no failure, the UI advanced, the page
 * settled. It is a false green with the evidence already in hand.
 *
 * The shape is ordinary in real backends: a field not in the UPDATE statement, a schema that strips
 * unknown keys, a PATCH that honours a subset, an enum that falls back to a default.
 *
 * ## Why this is narrow on purpose
 *
 * Servers legitimately transform what they echo — trimming, lower-casing, rounding, canonicalising,
 * filling defaults, assigning ids and timestamps. A rule that flagged every echoed field that differs
 * would fire on healthy APIs constantly, and a contradiction kind that cries wolf gets filtered out
 * by the agents reading it, taking the true positives with it. So:
 *
 *  - only requests that are WRITES are considered. Reported from the field: a lookup that sends its
 *    key in the body (`POST /get-branding` with `{workspace_id}`) and gets a record back was graded
 *    as a half-applied write. The gate was on the RESPONSE being a success and never on the REQUEST
 *    being a write, so every successful call carrying a body read as a save — and the same key name
 *    legitimately means different things on the two sides of a request/response pair;
 *  - only keys the request actually SENT are considered;
 *  - only scalars, since deep structural diffing is where the false positives live;
 *  - values are compared NORMALISED (trimmed, case-folded, numbers as numbers), so `FR` vs `fr` and
 *    `1` vs `1.0` stay silent while `fr` vs `en` speaks;
 *  - if the key appears anywhere in the response carrying the requested value, it is treated as
 *    applied — an envelope that echoes both the old and the new value is not a dropped write.
 *
 * The residue after those filters is a field the caller set, the server echoed back, and the echoed
 * value is a genuinely different value. That is worth one line of an agent's attention.
