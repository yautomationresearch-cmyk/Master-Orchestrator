/**
 * Serve the IPv4-bound daemon on IPv6 loopback too, so `localhost` reaches it on every platform.
 *
 * The daemon binds `127.0.0.1` — deliberately, because Reticle must never be reachable off-host. But
 * `localhost` is a NAME, and on Windows Chrome resolves it to `::1` before `127.0.0.1`. The SDK's
 * default bridge URL says `localhost`. So on the platform that is most of our installs, and the
 * browser that is most of that, the documented default cannot connect — and the error text names the
 * daemon, containers and WSL, none of which is the cause.
 *
 * This is a byte forwarder rather than a second `http.Server` on purpose. The daemon speaks HTTP,
 * WebSocket upgrades and SSE on one port; copying request/upgrade wiring onto a second server means a
 * second place to keep in sync, and the first handler anybody forgets to mirror becomes a bug that
 * only Windows sees. A TCP pipe carries all three and cannot drift from what it forwards.
 *
 * Best-effort by contract: a machine with IPv6 disabled, or something already holding `[::1]:port`,
 * leaves the daemon exactly as it was before. Never fatal — this widens reachability, it is not a
 * precondition for serving.
