/**
 * A regular beat, so SILENCE in the daemon log becomes evidence.
 *
 * `installExitTrace` hooks `'exit'`, which a SIGKILL never fires. So a daemon that is killed —
 * crashed, OOM-ed, swept by another project, `kill -9`'d by the recipe in every troubleshooting
 * thread — leaves no trace at all, and the last line before its port goes dark is whatever it
 * happened to be doing. Worse, a daemon that DID exit logs `code: 0`, so a tidy shutdown and a
 * violent death are the same shape to anyone reading the file.
 *
 * Measured cost of that: a correct SvelteKit install was written up as an install failure, because
 * the daemon had died 21 seconds earlier and nothing in the log said so. The fixture was named in the
 * report; the daemon was not.
 *
 * Two halves, and the second is what makes the first worth having:
 *   - DaemonHeartbeat emits `reticle_daemon_alive` on a fixed cadence, unconditionally.
 *   - classifyDaemonLife reads a log back and says which way the daemon ended.
 *
 * A heartbeat nobody interprets is just log volume.
