Two classes: single-channel faults (console errors, failed requests ≥400, DEAD controls that dispatched but did nothing) and CONTRADICTIONS — two channels disagreeing about the same click, e.g. the UI advanced while its write failed, a success signal fired over a failed request, a write succeeded and nothing changed, the same write fired twice, or the UI moved on over an in-flight request. Contradictions are the false greens a human cannot see, because a human watches one channel (the screen) and it looks correct.
