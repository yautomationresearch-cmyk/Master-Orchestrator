 * match what it can already prove is that a human sees the narrowing in a diff, and that only works
 * if the file lives with the code and travels with the PR. It is also why the writes are byte-stable:
 * a ledger that churns on every run is one whose diffs nobody reads.
 *
 * Every operation goes through the same file lock the other stores use, because two sessions driving
 * one project is ordinary and a lost declaration would be silent.
