/**
 * "authentication failed" when the real problem is a daemon from another project.
 *
 * Reported from the field: a sweep ended, its daemon was left holding port 4400, and the NEXT app —
 * freshly inited in a different worktree with its own pairing token — dialled that stale daemon and
 * got `bridge refused the connection: authentication failed`. The app was fine; the same fixture had
 * passed the gate minutes earlier. (Reproduced independently here: a leaked daemon on 4400 from my
 * own probes turned the e2e battery red in exactly this way.)
 *
 * "Authentication failed" sends someone to check a token. The token is correct — it is simply a
 * DIFFERENT project's token, because the daemon answering belongs to a different project. Those need
 * opposite fixes: one is "fix your token", the other is "that daemon is not yours, stop it".
 *
 * The discriminator is EVIDENCE, not derivation. The daemon and the SDK derive their project ids by
 * different schemes, so comparing them would report "different project" on every auth failure — the
 * same confidently-wrong diagnostic this is meant to replace. What the daemon knows for certain is
 * which projects it has ALREADY accepted a session from. If it has served project X and a HELLO
 * arrives for project Y with a bad token, this daemon demonstrably belongs to someone else.
