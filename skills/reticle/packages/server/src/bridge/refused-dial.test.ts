/**
 * A refused handshake left no trace anywhere, which closed a loop nobody could get out of.
 *
 * When the SDK dials and is turned away at the origin gate, the reason existed only in the page
 * console — which is unreadable without a session, which is exactly what the refusal prevents. The
 * daemon log recorded only SUCCESSFUL `session_connected` events, `doctor` reported every check
 * green, and the lease hint offered the generic port-mismatch differential. One reporter recovered
 * the real rule by grepping our compiled `dist` inside their own `node_modules`.
 *
 * Two things have to be true for that loop to open:
 *   1. the daemon REMEMBERS the refusal, with its reason
 *   2. the no-session diagnosis says so INSTEAD OF, and as well as, its generic differential —
 *      the rich hint used to be discarded entirely the moment a closure existed
