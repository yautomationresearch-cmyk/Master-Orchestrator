/**
 * Which `.reticle/` a session's artifacts belong in.
 *
 * Everything Reticle persists — flows, the capability contract, baselines, capsules, the cross-run
 * project memory — used to resolve against the DAEMON's own `process.cwd()`. That is a statement
 * about where the daemon was launched and it was being read as a statement about which project is
 * being verified. Those are not the same thing and are usually not even the same tree: a user-scoped
 * MCP registration is the common case, and the editor that spawns it starts it wherever it likes.
 *
 * Three field shapes, one defect: `cwd=/` gave `ENOENT: mkdir '/.reticle'`; a daemon started in
 * project A wrote project B's flow into A's checkout and reported success without naming the path;
 * and `verify_change` could only answer "unknown" because no flow could be persisted for it to match
 * against.
 *
 * ## Two sources, one rule
 *
 * Candidates arrive from config discovery (which walks out from the daemon's own directory) and from
 * the user-level project registry (which `init` writes, and which reaches checkouts discovery cannot
 * see). This function takes the merged list and does not know or care which source an entry came
 * from — a privileged source would be a second rule, and two rules for one question is how the
 * answers start disagreeing.
 *
 * ## Why matching on projectId, and not a new wire field
 *
 * HELLO already stamps `projectId`, and `.reticle.json` already declares the same id sitting next to
 * the code it configures. The join is therefore available today, for every SDK already in the field.
 * Adding a `root` to HELLO would move the wire contract, strand every older SDK on the fallback, and
 * buy nothing this does not already give.
 *
 * ## Why it can decline to answer
 *
 * Every non-matching branch returns the daemon root and SAYS which branch it was. A wrong root is
 * worse than no root — it writes a caller's evidence into a tree they never drove — so the ambiguous
 * case refuses rather than picks, exactly as `discoverProjectConfigs` refuses to pick one config.
 * The reason travels with the answer so callers can report the surprise instead of hiding it.
