/**
 * A Chromium hint you can satisfy by following it.
 *
 * `npx playwright install chromium` looks obviously right and is quietly wrong. `npx` resolves the
 * LATEST playwright, which pins a different browser revision than the playwright the daemon actually
 * bundles — so the command downloads ~90 MiB of a build the daemon will not use, and the check still
 * says missing afterwards. Reported from the field by an agent whose machine already had five
 * chromium builds, none of them the wanted one, with no way to learn which one was wanted.
 *
 * The same reporter came back, because pinning the command fixes only half of it. Their five builds
 * sat in the standard Windows browsers root and the line still read a flat `missing`, which leaves
 * two readings — "the check is broken" and "none of these count" — and no way to choose. Present at
 * the wrong revision and absent entirely are different problems: one is a single pinned download,
 * the other means the lookup is aimed at a root nothing was ever installed into. Collapsing them is
 * what made the loop unbreakable.
 *
 * Three things fix it, and they are what any unsatisfiable check needs: pin the command to the
 * version doing the asking, say what was probed, and separate the verdicts that have different
 * fixes. The wanted revision and the browsers root are both read back off the path Playwright itself
 * resolves, so `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` and every platform default are honoured by construction
 * rather than by a table of roots this file would have to keep in step with Playwright's.
