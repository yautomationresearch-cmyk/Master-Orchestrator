/**
 * What `doctor` says about the daemon it found — pure, so it can be tested without a socket.
 *
 * Doctor already stopped lying about the PORT: `probePresence` separates "a daemon is here" from "a
 * stranger holds it" from "nothing is listening", which was the load-bearing half of the report. It
 * still did not say WHICH daemon, though the `/status` payload it already fetches carries `version`
 * and `contract` and it discarded both.
 *
 * That is the gap worth closing, because skew is invisible everywhere else: a CLI and a daemon on
 * different contracts connect anyway and then disagree about behaviour, which reaches the agent as a
 * bare `-32000` naming no version at all. Doctor is the command a human runs at exactly that moment.
 *
 * Same split as `classifyPort`/`probePresence`: the rule lives here and is tested; the fetching stays
 * at the call site.
