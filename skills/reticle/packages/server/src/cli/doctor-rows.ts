/**
 * The row labels `reticle doctor` can print, and the one place that pads them into a column.
 *
 * These were free strings before, hand-padded at every call site across three modules
 * (`cli-doctor.ts`, `doctor-daemon-line.ts`, `doctor-sessions-line.ts`). Two problems with that,
 * and the second is the one that motivated #340:
 *
 * 1. The padding was maintained by eye. Every label happened to be padded to the same column, but
 *    nothing enforced it, and a label longer than the column would have quietly broken the
 *    alignment of one row in a checklist whose whole readability is the column.
 * 2. Nothing connected the labels to the docs pages that reproduce doctor's output. A row could be
 *    added, renamed or removed and the three pages showing sample output would go on describing the
 *    old vocabulary, with no gate noticing. `doctor` is the command a stuck user runs, and the docs
 *    are what they read when its output does not match what they were told to expect.
 *
 * The label set is exported so the docs guard can derive its expectation from the command rather
 * than from a hand-kept list, which is the direction that catches the case that actually bites: a
 * row added and never documented.
 *
 * NOT every row prints on every run. `version` prints only on skew, `port check` only on a
 * mismatch, `sibling` only when a well-known Reticle port other than ours has a listener,
 * `desktop` only on a desktop project, and `sessions` only when a daemon answered. The
 * vocabulary is therefore "what this command can print", not "what one run printed" — a guard built
 * by scraping a single invocation would silently stop covering the conditional rows, which are
 * exactly the ones a reader is least likely to have seen before.
