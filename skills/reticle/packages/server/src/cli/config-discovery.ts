/**
 * Where the project config actually is, and — when we cannot find it — where we looked.
 *
 * `findProjectConfig` walks UP from the daemon's working directory, which is right for a developer
 * who ran `reticle` in their project and wrong for the way most daemons are actually started.
 * Editors launch MCP servers from wherever they like, and in at least one popular one that is the
 * user's home directory: the config then sits at `<repo>/apps/web/.reticle.json`, the up-walk from
 * home never touches it, and Reticle confidently reports the project unwired. Reported twice, plus a
 * git-worktree variant of the same shape.
 *
 * So: walk up, then — from the repo root, if there is one — look in the workspace directories the
 * project's OWN manifest declares, falling back to the two conventions everybody uses.
 *
 * The second half is the `searched` list. "There is no `.reticle.json`" is unfalsifiable without it,
 * and this file exists because that claim was made, confidently, about configs that were right
 * there. Every result carries the places that were checked.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a "pick one" function. Several configs means several projects, and choosing one
 * silently is how an agent ends up with a confident verdict about an app it never touched. Callers
 * are handed the list and must name it.
