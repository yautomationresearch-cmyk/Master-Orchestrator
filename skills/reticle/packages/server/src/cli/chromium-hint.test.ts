/**
 * The Chromium hint must be satisfiable by following it, and arguable when it is wrong.
 *
 * The reported failure was a loop: doctor says missing, the user runs the suggested command, the
 * command succeeds, doctor still says missing. That is what an unpinned `npx playwright install`
 * does when the daemon bundles a different playwright — a different browser revision lands, and the
 * check the user was trying to satisfy never looked at it.
 *
 * The same reporter came back with the half of it that pinning does not fix. Their browsers root
 * held five chromium builds and the line still read a bare `missing`, so the only readings available
 * were "the check is broken" and "none of these count", with nothing to tell them apart. Present
 * but the wrong revision is a DIFFERENT problem from nothing installed: one is one download away,
 * the other means the lookup is pointed somewhere else. A line that collapses them is unactionable
 * however correct its verdict.
