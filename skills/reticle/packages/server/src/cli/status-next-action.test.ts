/**
 * `status` has to answer the question `init` sends the user here to ask.
 *
 * `init` ends with, verbatim: "Then run `npx @reticlehq/server status` — it confirms the app connected,
 * or says exactly why it has not." On a real install, following that instruction printed:
 *
 *     {"event":"reticle_status","port":4400,"running":false,"presence":"free"}
 *
 * No reason, no next step, and no mention of the app. The promise was three lines earlier in the same
 * output. This is the last checkpoint in the setup path, so a user who reaches it and learns nothing
 * has nowhere left to go — and most users never get past this step.
 *
 * The differential itself is NOT rebuilt here: `nextActionFor` already ranks these causes from what
 * the daemon knows, and a second opinion that disagreed with the first would be worse than no second
 * opinion at all.
