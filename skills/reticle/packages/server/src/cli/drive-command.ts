 * Decide who gets the port BEFORE binding it — and when the answer is "the daemon", ask it instead.

 * server object long after `start` has resolved, so the `.catch` on that promise could never see it
 * and the process died with the raw `node:net` EADDRINUSE stack — in the one situation this command
 * is most often run in, since `reticle_sessions` recommends `reticle drive` for a throttled tab and
 * a throttled tab nearly always coexists with the daemon holding the port. Refusing politely was
 * only half a fix: the way out it named (`reticle stop`, then retry) is a race the user loses,
 * because the MCP proxy respawns a daemon into the gap. So a healthy daemon is now ATTACHED to —
 * see cli/drive-attach.ts.
