/**
 * Who gets the bridge port when `reticle drive <url>` runs — and what happens when the answer is
 * "not you".
 *
 * `drive` used to bind :4400 unconditionally. A daemon on that port is the NORMAL state the moment
 * any MCP client has started one, so the bind died with a raw `node:net` EADDRINUSE stack — in the
 * exact situation the product tells people to run `drive` in, since `reticle_sessions` recommends it
 * for a throttled tab and a throttled tab nearly always coexists with the daemon that makes the bind
 * impossible. Two independent field reports hit it; the second lost half an hour to the workaround,
 * because `reticle stop` frees the port and the MCP proxy respawns a daemon into the gap before
 * `drive` can bind, so the "escape hatch" is a race the user cannot win.
 *
 * The fix is arbitration, not a better race:
 *
 * - **A healthy daemon owns the port → ATTACH.** Driving is a REQUEST to the process that already
 *   owns the browser plane, not a competing process. The daemon hands out a pooled, isolated,
 *   never-throttled context (the same one `reticle_lease` returns) and the caller gets back a
 *   sessionId every Reticle tool — including the ones the agent already has open on that daemon —
 *   can address. Nothing is bound, so there is nothing to race for and no reason to run `stop`.
 * - **Nothing on the port → BIND.** Unchanged: `drive` is still a self-contained foreground engine
 *   with its own browser when it can have the port.
 * - **A stranger owns the port → REFUSE**, naming the holder. Neither binding nor attaching can
 *   work, and pretending otherwise is the lie this module exists to remove.
 *
 * Making `stop` block until the port is genuinely free (and muzzling the proxy meanwhile) was the
 * alternative. It is strictly more machinery — a cross-process handoff, a suppression window, a new
 * way for the proxy to be wrong — to earn the same browser the daemon can already open, and it would
 * still leave `drive` unable to run while an agent is working. Attaching deletes the race instead of
 * refereeing it.
