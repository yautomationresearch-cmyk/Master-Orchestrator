/**
 * `reticle kill` — free the bridge port without taking the agent's transport with it.
 *
 * The obvious incantation, `lsof -ti tcp:4400 | xargs kill -9`, also kills `reticle mcp`: the proxy
 * holds a CLIENT socket on that port, `-ti` does not filter to listeners, and so the one command
 * people reach for when the bridge is stuck destroys the channel they were trying to fix. What
 * follows is worse than an error — the client gets no reply at all, and nothing reaches the proxy log
 * because the process that writes it is the one that died. That is the mechanism behind most
 * "my MCP disconnected" reports (#114, #110).
 *
 * The safe form was written down, and a documented incantation is a worse answer than a command: it
 * has to be found, remembered, and typed correctly at the moment someone is already stuck. So this is
 * the command, and it signals exactly one pid — the LISTENER.
 *
 * It is not a rename of `stop`. `stop` reads the pid file, which is the right source when the daemon
 * we started is the daemon that is wedged, and no source at all when the pid file is stale, was never
 * written, or belongs to a daemon from another checkout. `kill` asks the PORT, which is the thing the
 * user actually wants freed, and falls back to the pid file only where the lookup cannot run.
