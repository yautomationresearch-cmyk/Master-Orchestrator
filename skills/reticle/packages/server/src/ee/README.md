# Reticle Enterprise (`ee/`)

Everything under this directory is **Reticle Enterprise** code, source-available under the [Reticle Enterprise License](./LICENSE) — **not** the FSL that covers the rest of `@reticlehq/server`.

- **Free** for development, testing, and evaluation.
- **Production use requires a valid Reticle Enterprise subscription license key.**

## Rules for code in this directory

- Enterprise-only features live here and **nowhere else**. The free server must never `import` from `ee/`; the dependency only ever points `ee/ → core`, never the reverse, so the OSS build is always complete on its own.
- Every enterprise feature entry point calls `assertEnterprise(feature)` (imported from the open-core gate at `../license/license.js`) before doing privileged work. The licensing _mechanism_ is open (FSL) so it's inspectable and the OSS build is complete; only the _features_ here are gated.
- The wire contract these features speak is defined in `@reticlehq/core` (Apache-2.0), so free and enterprise builds can never drift apart.

## What belongs here (post-v0.9.0)

SSO / SAML, SCIM, RBAC / team permissions, audit logs, multi-org management, policy enforcement / verify-before-merge gates, and the hosted control-plane connectors. None of these ship in v0.9.0 — this directory and its license boundary exist now so the line is set before the features arrive.
