/**
 * A module that nothing imports must be DECLARED unwired, not discovered by an auditor.
 *
 * Four modules sat in the tree with doc comments written in the present tense — describing behaviour
 * the product does not have. The worst claimed "the server snapshots registered store paths + storage
 * keys BEFORE dispatching an action and again after", which nothing does; anyone reading the source to
 * evaluate the product would conclude that fallback exists. Dead code is cheap; dead code that asserts
 * it is alive is a lie told to the next reader.
 *
 * This test does not ban orphans — some are staged work with real tests, and deleting them would throw
 * away sound code. It bans UNDECLARED orphans: to add one you must name it here, which is exactly the
 * moment to ask whether it should be wired or removed.
