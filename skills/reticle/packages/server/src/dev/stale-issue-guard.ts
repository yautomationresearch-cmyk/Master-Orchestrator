/**
 * An issue we have already fixed must not still read as available work.
 *
 * Three contributor PRs died on arrival in one week for this. #373 was filed at 09:52 and fixed by
 * us at 12:33 the same day, then left open for three more days — somebody started on it on day two.
 * #398 shipped and stayed open; a second contributor rebuilt it from scratch. `GITHUB.md` already
 * documents the same failure costing three contributors before either of those, which makes this the
 * third recurrence of a defect we have written down and asked ourselves to remember.
 *
 * Remembering is not a mechanism, and this is the smallest one that works: a commit saying it closes
 * an issue is a claim that the issue is done. If that issue is still open and unlabelled afterwards,
 * the tracker is lying to whoever reads it next — and the person it lies to is by definition someone
 * looking for something to work on.
 *
 * ## Why `fixed-pending-release` is an accepted answer
 *
 * Work fixed on an unreleased branch is legitimately still open; the issue closes when the version
 * ships. The label is what tells a contributor not to start, so the label — not the closure — is
 * what this guard is actually asking for. That is also why the fix is cheap: nobody has to change
 * when they close things, only to say so.
 *
 * Pure. The git log and the GitHub lookup belong to the caller, which is what makes every branch
 * below testable without a network or a repo.
