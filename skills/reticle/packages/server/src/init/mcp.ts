/**
 * Global (user-scope) MCP registration for `reticle init`. The bridge + MCP server is a single
 * process that serves every project, so it is registered ONCE at user scope — not per-project via
 * a checked-in `.mcp.json`. We shell out to the official `claude mcp add -s user` CLI rather than
 * hand-editing `~/.claude.json` (a large stateful file). When the `claude` CLI is absent we print a
 * manual instruction instead.
 *
 * The registration is intentionally PORTLESS — `npx @reticlehq/server mcp`, never `--port N`. A single
 * global entry serves every project, so baking a port into it would pin every project to one port
 * and defeat per-project isolation. Instead `reticle mcp` resolves the port at runtime from the
 * project's `.reticle.json` in its CWD (see cli-port.ts). The port belongs to the project, not the
 * global agent config.

 * The registered command is STILL bare `npx` on every platform, deliberately.

 * Windows is most of Reticle's users and, when this was written, had no CI. There is Windows CI
 * now, so the `cmd /c` fallback is testable. Defaulting the majority platform to that launch
 * command is still the riskier change: `.cmd` has spawn caveats in some hosts, and a registration
 * that works on the machines we can test can still fail in the hosts we cannot. So the fallback
 * stays documented rather than defaulted.
 *
 * What DID change is when it is printed. `mcpManual` used to run only when the `claude` CLI was
 * absent. The reported Windows install had `claude mcp add` succeed, so the one paragraph that
 * would have unblocked zero tools never appeared. `mcpWindowsNote` is that paragraph, and init
 * prints it on every Windows run — including the ones that look like a clean registration.

 * DELIBERATELY UNPINNED, and the trade is worth stating. `reticle init` pins the SDK to the CLI's
 * exact version, so on release day the app can be on the new one while npx serves a cached older
 * build — a real skew, reported from the field. Pinning this entry would remove that window.
 *
 * It would also freeze the agent's MCP server at whatever version was installed the day `init` ran,
 * for as long as that entry survives — and `reticle update` upgrades the CLI, not a global agent
 * config. Reticle's biggest measured problem is fixes not reaching people (2.4.0 reached zero users
 * before its nudge existed), and a permanent pin makes that worse for every install, to close a
 * window that lasts until the next npx cache miss.
 *
 * So it stays unpinned, and the skew is handled where it actually shows up: the contract fingerprint
 * makes a real mismatch loud on the next tool result (see version-skew), and a stale entry of our own
 * shape is now repaired on re-run rather than reported "already registered" (see cursor.ts).
