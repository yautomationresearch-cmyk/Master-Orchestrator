 *
 * Matched on TITLES, which is the fragile part and worth stating: renaming a step in

  // NOT here, and the reason is worth keeping: 'Pairing token'.
  //
  // It is a genuine connect step — CRA inlines only REACT_APP_*, so without the token in the env
  // file the bridge refuses every connection and the app boots, looks correct, and never pairs. But
  // it goes MANUAL in exactly one situation: no daemon has ever run on this machine, so there is no
  // token to inline. That is the FIRST CRA install on a fresh machine, i.e. the first-time user —
  // and making that exit non-zero reports a broken install to the one person least able to tell
  // that it is not.
  //
  // The real fix is for `init` to mint the token rather than only read it, which is what both the
  // daemon and the Vite plugin already do. `runInit` is synchronous and the existing helpers are
  // not, and `gate:install` scaffolds no CRA app, so that change would ship with no coverage of the
  // path it changes. It is worth doing, and worth doing with a scaffold behind it.
