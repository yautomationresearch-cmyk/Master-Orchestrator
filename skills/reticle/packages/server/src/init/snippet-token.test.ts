/**
 * A connect snippet without the pairing token cannot connect. Ever.
 *
 * `Bridge` closes the socket with AUTH_FAILED whenever it holds a token and the `hello` does not
 * carry a matching one (`bridge.ts`), and the daemon PROVISIONS one on startup unless it cannot
 * write to `$HOME` — so in the ordinary case the token is always set. A snippet that omits it
 * produces "bridge refused the connection: authentication failed" and no session, every time.
 *
 * Every other stack already knew this. Next reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_RETICLE_TOKEN`, SvelteKit and Vite
 * take `__RETICLE_TOKEN__` from the plugin's `define`, Astro reads the token file in its config, and
 * CRA gets a `Pairing token` step writing `.env` — that step is built two branches above this one in
 * the same planner, from the same `input.pairingToken`.
 *
 * The manual path got none of it. `htmlManual` was called with only a port and a projectId, so the
 * snippet it printed was `reticle.connect({ projectId: '...' })` — and that is the snippet handed to
 * plain static HTML, webpack, Parcel and any hand-wired setup, i.e. every stack with no build plugin
 * to inline it for them. Reported from the field, where it cost a long diagnostic session reading
 * bridge-security.ts before the cause was found.
 *
 * Kept as a snippet test for the same reason as `snippets-compile.test.ts`: this string is never
 * parsed, linted or run inside this repo. It is only ever executed on a stranger's machine.
