/**
 * `doctor`'s web CSP check — the sibling of the desktop one next door.
 *
 * The desktop findings exist because a Tauri app with the default CSP runs perfectly and never
 * connects. The WEB version of that failure had no check at all, and it arrived twice in one batch
 * of field reports: two Next apps where `init` printed success for every step, the SDK mounted, the
 * dial URL was right, and the browser silently refused the WebSocket because `connect-src` excluded
 * the bridge. The violation is reported in the browser's console and nowhere else, so every check on
 * this side stayed green while the app was permanently unreachable.
 *
 * Reads the files a CSP is actually written in, by name — a full source scan would be slower and
 * would find policy strings in test fixtures and documentation.
