/**
 * Telling a Python (or Ruby, or Go, or PHP) developer why Reticle cannot wire their app.
 *
 * `reticle init` answered "No package.json found here, and no app directory beneath it either",
 * which reads as *you are in the wrong directory* — so an agent on a Streamlit app went looking for
 * a directory that does not exist, then went looking for a standalone browser bundle to inject by
 * hand, and only worked out the real answer several steps later.
 *
 * The real answer is not about directories at all: Reticle's SDK has to be imported by the app's own
 * JS build, and a server-rendered Python app has no JS build to import it from. That is a property
 * of the project, it is knowable from one look at the filesystem, and saying it plainly costs the
 * reader nothing while the directory message costs them the whole investigation.
 *
 * Deliberately a hint, not a refusal: a Django or Rails app with a `frontend/` package.json is a
 * perfectly ordinary Reticle install, and this only ever speaks when there is no package.json to be
 * found anywhere.
