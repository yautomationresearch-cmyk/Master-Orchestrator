/**
 * A `⚠` on a step that decides whether the app can dial the daemon is not a warning. It is a
 * guaranteed failure: nothing performs a manual step, so no session ever appears and every Reticle
 * tool answers "no browser session connected".
 *
 * `CONNECT_STEP_TITLES` is what makes `init` exit non-zero in that case. Two steps that decide
 * exactly this were missing from it, so `init` reported `ok` and exited 0 over an app that could
 * never connect — the same shape as the release where Next connected none of the time.
 *
 * Both are titles, matched as strings, which is the fragile part: renaming a step in
 * `plan-framework.ts` silently drops it out of this set and nothing goes red. So these tests assert
 * the two directions that matter — the titles this set must contain, and that every title in it is a
 * title some framework actually emits.
