/**
 * Does this app's Content-Security-Policy let the browser reach the Reticle bridge?
 *
 * Two independent field reports, both Next: `init` reported every step successful, the SDK mounted,
 * the dial URL was correct, and the app never connected because a strict `connect-src` excluded
 * `ws://localhost:<port>`. The browser blocks the WebSocket and says so in its own console, which
 * nothing on the Reticle side reads — so `status` and `doctor` reported perfect health at an app
 * that could not connect at all, forever. A setup step that exits 0 while leaving the user broken is
 * the worst failure mode this repo has.
 *
 * A TEXT SCAN, deliberately. `headers()` is a function; `init` cannot execute a user's Next config
 * without importing their whole app, and the thing worth finding is the policy string a developer
 * typed — in `next.config.*`, in middleware, or in a `<meta http-equiv>` tag. The scan finds the
 * string wherever it is written.
 *
 * NARROW on purpose: it fires only when a `connect-src` exists AND does not admit the bridge. No
 * CSP, or one that already covers us, produces nothing. A warning that fires on a working setup
 * costs precisely what a green check on a broken one costs, and this file exists because of the
 * second kind.
