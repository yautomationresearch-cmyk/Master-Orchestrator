/**
 * A page with no build step CAN load the SDK, and `init` used to say it could not.
 *
 * The manual snippet told plain-static-HTML users that "the browser can't resolve the bare
 * '@reticlehq/react' import, so bundle the SDK once (e.g. `npx esbuild`) or serve the page through
 * a dev server". True of a BARE specifier and false of the thing that matters: a CDN URL resolves in
 * any browser, needs no npm, no bundler and no package.json.
 *
 * That sentence was the end of the road for every server-rendered app we hear from: FastAPI and
 * Flask serving static HTML, Django, Streamlit, Rails. Each of them was told by `init` to go and
 * build a JavaScript pipeline they do not have, in order to use a tool that needed no such thing.
 *
 * Verified end to end before this was written, not reasoned about: a plain page served by
 * `python3 -m http.server`, one `<script type="module">` importing from a CDN, produced a connected
 * session, a snapshot, and two `reticle_act_and_wait` verdicts of `verified: "yes"`.
 *
 * A snippet test, for the same reason as `snippets-compile.test.ts` and `snippet-token.test.ts`:
 * this string is never parsed, linted or executed inside this repo. It only ever runs on a
 * stranger's machine, so the only thing standing between a typo and a stranger is this file.
