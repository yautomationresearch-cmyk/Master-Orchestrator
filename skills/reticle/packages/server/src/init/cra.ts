/**
 * Wiring Reticle into a Create React App project.
 *
 * CRA had no automated path: init reported `⚠ Connect snippet → index.html`, a target that cannot
 * work. CRA's `public/index.html` is a static template the bundler never processes for modules, so a
 * bare import in it resolves to nothing. `src/index.tsx` is what gets bundled, and that is where the
 * connect has to arrive.
 *
 * The token is the second half of the problem. Every other stack has somewhere to inline it —
 * Vite defines `__RETICLE_TOKEN__`, the Astro and HTML snippets read the file in Node. `src/index.tsx`
 * is browser code inside a bundler that inlines exactly one thing: environment variables prefixed
 * `REACT_APP_`. So it travels through `.env.development.local`, which is CRA's own documented
 * mechanism and is gitignored by CRA's own template.

 * CANNOT travel with the repo — that part is correct and must stay. What was wrong is that it failed
 * silently: a teammate clones, runs `npm start`, and the app connects with an empty token, so the
 * only signal is the bridge's generic `authentication failed` in a console nobody had open. Naming
 * the variable, the gitignored file and the one command that fixes it turns a dead app into a
 * one-line repair. Every other stack reads the token in Node at dev-server start (the Vite plugin,
 * withReticle); CRA has no such hook without ejecting, so this message is the fix.
