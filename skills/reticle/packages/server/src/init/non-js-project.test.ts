/**
 * "No package.json found here" is the wrong answer to a Python project.
 *
 * It reads as a wrong-directory error, so the reader goes looking for a directory — which is what an
 * agent on a Streamlit app did, before hunting for a standalone browser bundle to inject by hand.
 * Neither search could have succeeded: the SDK has to be imported by the app's own JS build, and
 * there was no JS build.
