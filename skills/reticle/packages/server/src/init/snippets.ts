  return `Nuxt owns its own Vite instance and renders its own HTML, so there is no vite.config to patch
and no index.html to inject into. Wire it with a dev-only CLIENT plugin, which is Nuxt's own idiom:

1. Create ${NUXT_PLUGIN_PATH}:

     export default defineNuxtPlugin(() => {
       // import.meta.dev is the correct guard: it is resolved at build time, so it does not care
       // what hostname you develop on. Do NOT guard on window.location.hostname === 'localhost' —
       // that is false on any hosts-file alias or LAN address, and window does not exist in SSR.
       if (!import.meta.dev) return
       void import('@reticlehq/browser').then(({ reticle }) => {
         ${connect}
       })
     })

   The .client.ts suffix is load-bearing: it is what keeps this out of the server bundle.

2. Restart the dev server. A dev server that is already running does not pick up a new plugin —
   it will not appear in .nuxt/plugins/client.mjs, and the app will come up with no SDK at all.

3. If your dev host is anything other than localhost (a hosts-file alias, a LAN IP, a tunnel), that
   connect call needs TWO additions, not one: allowNonLocalhost: true AND a pairing token passed as
   token. The flag alone is NOT sufficient off localhost. The token is the one in
   ~/.reticle/pairing-token. Without both, the SDK loads and then refuses, and the only sign is one
   line in the browser console.

4. Add this to nuxt.config, so the dev server does not watch Reticle's own journal:

     vite: { server: { watch: { ignored: [/(^|[\\\\/])\\.${ReticleDir.ROOT.slice(1)}([\\\\/]|$)/] } } }

   Reticle journals every session into ${ReticleDir.ROOT}/ in your project root, rewriting one file
   in it continuously while a session is live. Nuxt's dev server watches that root, so without this
   it sees each write as a project file changing and full-reloads the page — which reconnects the
   SDK, which produces the next write. The loop runs several times a second and looks like anything
   except what it is: refs go stale, actions die mid-flight, and the session appears to flap.
   It is a RegExp rather than a glob on purpose — chokidar dropped glob support in v4, so a
   double-star pattern here is accepted and matches nothing.

The package is @reticlehq/browser — the framework-neutral sensor. DOM, network, console, routing and
source file:line all work in Vue. What you do not get is React component identity, which is the only
thing the React adapter adds. There is no Nuxt app in this project's CI, so this path is UNVERIFIED:
if something does not work, please open an issue.`;
