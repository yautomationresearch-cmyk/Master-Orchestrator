/**
 * Where each agent keeps its MCP config, and how to write ours into it.
 *
 * `init` knew two clients: Claude Code (a CLI shell-out) and Cursor (a JSON merge). Everything else
 * got a printed snippet. That is the blocker under the whole release matrix — a per-client release
 * artifact for a client `init` cannot wire measures whether somebody pasted JSON correctly, not
 * whether the product works.
 *
 * Every path and shape below was read from the client's own documentation rather than recalled,
 * because they differ in ways that look like they should not:
 *
 *   Cursor / Windsurf / Gemini   `mcpServers: { name: { command, args } }` — one shape, three paths
 *   VS Code                      `servers:` — a different key entirely
 *   OpenCode                     `mcp: { name: { type, command: [cmd, ...args] } }` — an ARRAY
 *   Codex                        TOML
 *
 * A single "write mcp.json" assuming the Cursor shape would produce a file three of these ignore:
 * an install that reports success and registers nothing, which is the exact failure class this
 * repo's install gate exists to catch.
