 *   dropped there has no default export: `/reticle-dev` 500s and `next build` fails. It has to go
 *   somewhere that is not a route directory. App Router routes on FILENAME (`page`/`layout`/
 *   `route`), so an extra file beside the layout is inert and can stay there.
 * - **The extension is not cosmetic.** A `.tsx` file in a JavaScript project makes Next auto-install
 *   TypeScript on the next `next dev` — and on Next 13 that takes its require-hook down with it, so
 *   the dev server never starts. The install then looks like it broke the app, because it did.
