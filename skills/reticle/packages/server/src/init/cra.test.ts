/**
 * react-scripts had no automated connect path at all.
 *
 * Measured on a real CRA app: init reported `⚠ Connect snippet → index.html`. That target cannot
 * work — CRA's `public/index.html` is a static template the bundler never processes for modules, so
 * a bare `import '@reticlehq/react'` in it resolves to nothing. The connect has to arrive through
 * `src/index.tsx`, which IS bundled.
 *
 * CRA also cannot use the token trick every other stack uses. Vite defines `__RETICLE_TOKEN__` at
 * build time and the Astro/HTML snippets read the file in Node; `src/index.tsx` is browser code
 * inside a bundler that inlines exactly one thing — environment variables prefixed `REACT_APP_`. So
 * the token travels through `.env.development.local`, which is CRA's own documented mechanism and is
 * already gitignored by CRA's template.
