 * Pure, conservative patchers for an Astro app: the config gets the token/root `define` and the

 *
 * Astro was the last gated framework where `init` printed a correct recipe and applied none of it —
 * the only ⚠ left on a supported stack, and the user's first session was two hand-copied snippets
 * away. Astro is Vite-based but renders its own HTML, so the Vite plugin's injection never fires and
 * there is no entry module to wire: the connect has to live in a page or layout `<script>`, and the
 * token has to be inlined by the config because nothing else is in the page's path to inject it.
 *
 * Both patchers bail to `manual` (the printed recipe) on any shape they do not fully recognise.
 * Half-editing a build config is worse than a documented manual step.
