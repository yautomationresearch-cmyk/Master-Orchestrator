/**
 * A Vue or Svelte codebase must not be told to install `@reticlehq/react`.
 *
 * The reasoning was already written down in this file, for Nuxt:
 *
 *   "The framework-neutral sensor, NOT the React kit. Nuxt renders Vue, and installing a package
 *    named @reticlehq/react — with `react` in its peer dependencies — into a Vue codebase is the
 *    single thing most likely to make someone abandon the setup, whether or not it works."
 *
 * It was applied to the one framework whose NAME implies Vue, and not to the case where the same
 * thing is true and the name does not say so. A Vue app on plain Vite is `Framework.VITE`, and a
 * SvelteKit app is Svelte, and both were handed the React kit.
 *
 * Found by running `reticle init --dry-run` against a real Electron + Vue + Pinia app (MarkText, the
 * `electron-vue-pinia` fixture from #121, which nobody had ever run the installer against). The
 * output detected Vue correctly, said in as many words that React component identity is what you
 * will NOT get — and then, four lines later, told the reader to install `@reticlehq/react`.
 *
 * The UI library is detected before any of this runs, so the information was there the whole time.
