/**
 * `init`'s last line is the one an agent acts on, and it was telling agents to stop when they should
 * have carried on.
 *
 * The restart advice branched on `wasMcpRegistered`, which is true for BOTH `APPLY` (we registered
 * the server just now) and `ALREADY` (it was registered by an earlier install). That predicate is
 * right for the funnel field it was written for — "is MCP registered on this machine" — and wrong
 * for the question the hint asks, because those two cases have opposite answers: a fresh
 * registration needs a client restart before the tools exist, and a pre-existing one does not.
 *
 * So on every machine that had ever run `init` before, and on every Claude Code plugin install
 * (where the plugin registers the server itself), the report ended with "restart your agent — the
 * tools only appear after that". An agent reads that AFTER whatever the skill file told it, and it
 * describes the tool output in front of it, so it wins: the agent stops, the user restarts for no
 * reason, and the onboarding turn ends with a wired project and nothing driven. That is the failure
 * the whole install path is written to avoid, produced by the install path itself.
 *
 * The rule these pin: only a registration that HAPPENED THIS RUN may ask anybody to restart.
