/**
 * ReticleRunner — the programmatic Replay/Verify API a host platform (OEM/design partner) or CI drives
 * from its own pipeline, with no MCP stdio and no human. It reuses the existing flow-replay machinery
 * and the verification-run assembler, returning a stable ReticleVerificationRun.
 *
 * Everything it needs from the live world is injected through RunnerPort, so the core orchestration is
 * fully testable without a CDP browser. The live adapter (wrapping ToolDeps: replayNamedFlow,
 * flows.list, the drive/CDP preview boot) and the token-guarded HTTP endpoint are thin layers built on
 * top of this — the orchestration and the verdict live here so the MCP path and the API produce the
 * same artifact byte-for-byte.
