/**
 * Finish a truncated snapshot, or say it could not be finished.
 *
 * The snapshot walk stops at its node cap and returns a document-order PREFIX with `truncated:true`.
 * That flag has always been honest and has never been actionable: it says the read stopped, not
 * where, so a caller could receive half a page and draw a NEGATIVE conclusion from it — "no error is
 * shown", "the row is gone" — when the thing was simply past the cut. A read that under-reports is a
 * verification result that is quietly wrong.
 *
 * The walk now names its own frontier (`unread`: refs of the subtrees it never entered), so the cut
 * is recoverable: re-read each branch at its own path and the union is the whole tree. This is that
 * loop, plus the half that matters — when the union CANNOT be assembled it says so, and the caller
 * must not turn an empty result over it into an absence.
 *
 * The assembled tree is a UNION of subtrees, not a re-render: each appended chunk is indented from
 * its own root. Callers scan it line by line (that is what every consumer of `tree` does), so the
 * indentation restart costs nothing and re-walking the whole page from scratch would cost a lot.

 * net. Twelve covers a page whose cut frontier is a handful of branches a couple of levels deep —
 * the shape a node cap actually produces — while keeping the worst case near a dozen round-trips
 * rather than a walk of the DOM one subtree at a time.
