/**
 * `reticle_coverage` — which interactive controls this session has driven, and which it has not.
 *
 * Every other read here answers a question the agent already thought to ask, which bounds
 * verification by the agent's imagination — the documented weak link. This answers the one question
 * that tells the agent whether to STOP: an agent that exercised 4 of 17 controls and believes it
 * verified the page is exactly the confident-and-wrong case Reticle exists to prevent, and nothing
 * in the tool surface previously contradicted it.
 *
 * Note this is NOT the existing `blindSpots` coverage, which is about what the layer could not SEE
 * (closed shadow roots, cross-origin frames). This is about what the agent did not TOUCH. Both are
 * honesty signals; they answer different questions and neither substitutes for the other.
 *
 * Unadvertised by every profile: it costs nothing per turn and is reached through `reticle_run`.
