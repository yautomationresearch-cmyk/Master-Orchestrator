/**
 * What `navigate { reload: true }` reports.

 * It answered a bare `{ ok: true }`, while the URL branch of the same tool returns `confirmed: false`
 * plus a note — because `ok` means the browser accepted the instruction, not that the page arrived.
 * Identical semantics, one branch disclosing them and one not, and the silent one is the path most
 * likely to need the caveat: a reload tears the SDK down, and a caller that acts on `ok: true` hits
 * the window before it comes back.
 *
 * The permanent session loss reported alongside this is fixed separately — session-continuity.ts
 * remembers the id in sessionStorage so a reload rejoins the SAME session instead of appearing as a
 * new one. This is the remaining half: saying that the page is not back yet.
