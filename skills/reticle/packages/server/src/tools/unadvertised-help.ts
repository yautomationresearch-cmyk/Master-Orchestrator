/**
 * What to say when an agent calls a real Reticle tool that this profile does not advertise.
 *
 * The default surface advertises 18 of 48 tools, and the extended one 30. That is deliberate — every
 * advertised tool's schema is re-sent on every turn, and editors budget MCP tools as a COUNT shared
 * across every connected server — and everything omitted stays fully callable through `reticle_run`,
 * which `surface-reachability.test.ts` guards.
 *
 * The gap was in the ERROR. The MCP SDK answers `Tool <name> not found`, which is indistinguishable
 * from "this tool does not exist", so an agent that trusts it stops trying. Reported from a real
 * sweep of a Next app-router project: the first pass scored 25 failures that were nothing of the
 * kind — every one of those tools worked through `reticle_run` seconds later.
 *
 * So: a name Reticle owns never comes back as "not found". It comes back with the call that works
 * and the switch that makes it stop being necessary.
