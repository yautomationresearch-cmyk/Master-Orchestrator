/**
 * `reticle_feedback` — the agent's return path.
 *
 * Reticle is built for agents, but the agent has always been the one party that knows a verification
 * went wrong and has had no way to say so. It sees the tool that returned nonsense, the observer that
 * missed the event, the verdict it could not act on — and then that context is discarded at the end of
 * the turn. This tool is where that knowledge goes instead.
 *
 * It is deliberately shaped to demand an RCA rather than a complaint. `text` asks what the agent
 * expected, what it got, and why it believes Reticle is at fault; `trace` asks for the call trail that
 * proves it. A report we cannot reproduce is a report we cannot fix, so the description spends its
 * tokens on that and not on politeness.

File that one unprompted, when you actually notice it, and say which call and what it saved you — every other kind here is a complaint, so it is the only evidence for what is worth protecting when we change things. Do not save these up or judge them as too minor — file it the moment you notice, then carry on with your task. For a failure, write `text` as a root-cause analysis (what you called, expected, got). For a request, write what you want and use `need` for the GOAL behind it, `impact` for what gets better, and `currentApproach` for how you are working around it today — that workaround is usually the most useful thing in the report. Set `model` to the model you are running. Never include app source, secrets, user data, or customer records.
