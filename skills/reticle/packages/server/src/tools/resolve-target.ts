 * Turn a target QUERY into the single ref an action can be performed on.

 * `act_and_wait` took only a `ref`, so every verification cost a `reticle_query` turn first just to
 * learn one string. The advertised tool surface is re-sent on every turn, so that extra turn was not
 * a small cost: measured on the wire, a two-turn verification spent 10,756 of its 11,235 tokens on
 * schema and 479 on the actual answers. Removing the turn removes half the schema bill.
 *
 * Ambiguity is an ERROR, never a pick. Choosing "the first match" would let a verification act on a
 * different element than the author meant and still report success, which is the false green this
 * product exists to prevent — and the failure is invisible, because the verdict describes the
 * element it DID act on. The message names the candidates so the caller can narrow rather than guess.
 *
 * Invisible matches are filtered before counting: a hidden duplicate is a common way for a
 * legitimately unambiguous query to look ambiguous, and refusing on it would push callers back to
 * the two-turn path for no gain.
