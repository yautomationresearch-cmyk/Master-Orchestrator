/**
 * The honest envelope for a navigation nobody can confirm.
 *
 * `window.location.assign(url)` returns before the page moves, and the SDK that would report on the
 * new document is destroyed by the navigation itself. So a successful NAVIGATE means the browser
 * accepted the instruction — not that anything arrived. Driven against a dead URL it returned
 * `{"ok":true}` while the session died, which is the worst combination available: the agent believes
 * it navigated, is looking at nothing, and has lost Reticle.
 *
 * `reticle_act` already draws this line — `dispatched` (sent) versus `settled` (a frame flushed).
 * This gives navigate the same honesty without changing what it does.
