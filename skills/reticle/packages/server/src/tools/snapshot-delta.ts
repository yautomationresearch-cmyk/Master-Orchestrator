/**
 * Server-side snapshot delta — return only what CHANGED since the agent's last look.
 *
 * Why (grounded): screenshot/Playwright-MCP agents accrue 60–80K tokens of stale accessibility-tree
 * data over a session and start hallucinating selectors that no longer exist. The agent-facing cost
 * is the MCP result it reads (not the internal WS payload), so computing the delta here — and
 * returning only added/removed lines — directly cuts the tokens the model spends AND removes the
 * stale full-tree that drives hallucination. Reuses the same normalize+diff the baseline layer uses,
 * so "what changed" means the same thing everywhere.
 *
 * Pure decision (`snapshotDelta`) + a small route-invalidated cache (`SnapshotCache`). A route change
 * invalidates the prior snapshot (a diff across pages would be meaningless), so the next snapshot
 * returns full — never a misleading cross-page delta.
 */

/**
 * Identity for comparison, ref for action.
 *
 * The delta path used `normalizeLines` from the baseline layer, which strips the ref marker on
 * purpose — a ref stored in a baseline would make every later diff noisy. Correct there, wrong here:
 * every delta line came back as `- button "Row actions"` with no ref, and acting needs a ref, so the
 * full snapshot had to be taken anyway. The diff call cost tokens and bought nothing. One helper, two
 * callers, opposite requirements — so this path keeps the ref-stripped line as the KEY and emits the
 * ORIGINAL line with its ref.
 *
 * Focus is stripped from the key too. It rides in the line as `[focused]`, alone or comma-joined with
 * other states, so a focus move used to surface as one line removed and its twin added — structural
 * change reported where nothing had been added at all. Focus is a property OF a line, so it gets its
 * own field. Only focus is exempt: `disabled` moving is a real change and must still show.
