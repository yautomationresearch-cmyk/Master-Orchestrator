/**
 * "The app ignored this response" is only sayable once the app has had a chance to read it.
 *
 * `response-ignored` fires when a write succeeded on the server and nothing on the client moved. It
 * is a genuine and valuable finding — a lost write, a response parsed into the void, a render that
 * never happened. It is also an ACCUSATION, and it is decided by a window boundary.
 *
 * Waiting for in-flight requests before taking the verdict made that boundary dangerous in a way it
 * was not before. Previously the write was still pending when the window closed, so it never reached
 * the `settled` list and this rule could not fire at all. Now the response lands inside the window by
 * design — and the app's re-render happens in a later task, a few milliseconds after. Close the
 * window in that gap and every channel agrees the app took a successful write and did nothing.
 *
 * The verdict would be `verified: "no"` on a completely correct application, produced entirely by
 * where we chose to stop looking. That is a false green's evil twin and the more damaging one for a
 * verification tool: it accuses.
 *
 * So the response is not the end of the window — the app's REACTION to it is. When a successful write
 * settles and nothing has moved yet, wait briefly for the reaction, bounded by the caller's remaining
 * budget. Only after that grace has passed with nothing at all is "ignored" an honest word.
 *
 * The grace is paid only in the exact case that would otherwise be accused: a successful mutating
 * write with no movement after it. An action that already moved the UI returns immediately.
