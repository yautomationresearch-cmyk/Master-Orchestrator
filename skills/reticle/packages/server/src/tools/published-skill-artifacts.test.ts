 * skills found. Skills require a SKILL.md with name and description" for as long as the only
 * SKILL.md in the repo was the paste-URL copy at root — the registry route was dead on arrival and
 * nothing said so, because no gate has an opinion about a markdown file's first ten lines.
 *
 * And `.claude-plugin` sat at 2.7.0 through the 2.8.0 release. A plugin version is what a user's
 * `/plugin` UI shows and what decides whether an update is offered, so a stale one silently pins
 * everybody who installed it. Release tooling does not know the file exists.
 *
 * Both are one-line mistakes that survive every other gate in this repo, which is the whole argument
