 *   core       16 tools   18,183 B   ~4,546 tok/turn

 *   full       48 tools  127,903 B  ~31,976 tok/turn
 *
 * `core` was byte-identical to `hybrid`. `standard` charged ~3,500 tokens every turn for reach that
 * `reticle_run` already provided. `dynamic` was selected by nothing in this repo and is contradicted
 * by our own measurement — a pure on-demand surface does not hold accuracy with a generic model.
 *
 * `full` is the one that survives, and NOT as a profile: it is the only mode that advertises
 * `outputSchema`, which is what makes the MCP layer validate tool OUTPUT. Folding that into the
 * default was measured at 18,183 -> 41,117 bytes (2.26x, +5,733 tok/turn), so it cannot be the
 * default; deleting it would lose the defect class the surface sweep catches. So it is a switch,
 * named for what it does, and no user is asked to choose it.
