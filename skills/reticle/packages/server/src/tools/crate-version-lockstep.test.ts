/**
 * The Rust crate must ship the version everything else ships.
 *
 * `reticle-tauri` sat at `0.1.0` from the day it was written on 2026-08-02 until 2.11.0. Nothing
 * bumped it, and `publish-crate.yml` publishes only when the version is ABSENT from crates.io — so
 * every release in the 2.x line ran that job, found `0.1.0` already there, printed "nothing to do",
 * and exited successfully. A silent no-op reporting green, on every release, for months.
 *
 * The cost was not theoretical. `d09cd5c6` moved desktop captures out of the shared OS temp
 * directory, where they were written under a name any local process could work out — a public
 * prefix, a readable pid, and a counter starting at zero. That fix merged on 2026-08-13 and reached
 * nobody, because the only published crate was the one from before it, and the docs told users to
 * pin `reticle-tauri = "0.1"`, which resolves to exactly that build.
 *
 * The docs called this "versioned independently — deliberate, not drift". True as written and false
 * in effect: it was not versioned, it was stuck.
 *
 * So the crate moves in lockstep, and this is what makes lockstep a fact rather than an intention.
 * A release that bumps the ten npm packages and forgets the eleventh artifact now fails here, in the
 * fast unit gate, instead of silently shipping nothing.
