/**
 * A guard that reads another package's files must be invalidated by them.
 *
 * Tests across this repo scan trees outside their own package: browser sources, the docs site,
 * `apps/`, `bench/`, the skills, the plugin manifests, the Rust crate. Turbo's cache key for a
 * `#test:unit` task is, by default, that package plus its dependency graph. So a change anywhere in
 * those other trees left the key untouched and the guards replayed a pass recorded against
 * different files.
 *
 * Reproduced before this was written: edit `packages/browser/src/dom/refs.ts`, run `pnpm test:unit`,
 * and `@reticlehq/server:test:unit` reports `cache hit, replaying logs`. The guard did not run.
 *
 * That is a false green in the gate itself, which is worse than the defects these guards catch: the
 * whole value of a source-scanning guard is that it fails locally, before CI. It surfaced when a
 * heavy browser test was added, the full local gate went green, and CI then failed on macos, windows
 * and verify at once, the signature of a real failure rather than a flake. The person running it did
 * nothing wrong; `pnpm test:unit` said success, and the guard is what is supposed to stop that.
 *
 * The fix is `inputs` on the task using `$TURBO_ROOT$`, which turbo 2.x supports and which
 * [#282](https://github.com/reticlehq/reticle/issues/282) doubted would work. It does; it was
 * measured. That beats `globalDependencies` (busts every task's cache on any change) and beats
 * moving the guards to a new tooling package (a bigger change for the same result).
 *
 * ## Why this checks every package and not one
 *
 * It used to check `@reticlehq/server` alone, and that is how the same hole reopened in
 * `@reticlehq/core`: `desktop-contract.test.ts` reads the Rust crate's `capture.rs` and `lib.rs` to
 * hold the daemon and the crate to one contract, core's task declared no `inputs`, and so breaking
 * that agreement replayed a green recorded against Rust the suite never opened.
 *
 * Fixing that one package the way the first was fixed would leave the rule exactly as findable as it
 * was the first time, which is to say not at all. A guard scoped to the package that happened to be
 * caught is a guard that catches each package once. So the scan is over every package that has a
 * `src`, and a new cross-package guard is covered on the day it lands rather than on the day
 * somebody notices.
 *
 * This test exists because the fix is a config file nobody reads. The next cross-package guard will
 * be written by someone who does not know turbo.json is load-bearing, and it would be silently
 * uncached from the day it lands, indistinguishable from working.
