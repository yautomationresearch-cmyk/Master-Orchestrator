/**
 * Where a merged or retired tool's old name went.
 *
 * Twenty-two names exported from `ReticleTool` are no longer tools: `reticle_record_start` became
 * `reticle_record { action: "start" }`, `reticle_diff` became `reticle_baseline { action: "diff" }`,
 * and three were retired outright. Confirmed live in a field sweep, they all answered `unknown tool`
 * — which is the wrong answer, because the capability exists and only moved. An agent trained on an
 * earlier release, or reading the merged tool's own description (which names every action), reaches
 * for exactly these.
 *
 * DERIVED from `MERGE_PLANS` and `RETIRED_FROM_SURFACE` rather than written out, so the next merge is
 * covered the day it lands instead of the day someone notices.
