/**
 * Does the screen agree with the data the app was given?
 *
 * A separate tool rather than a passive contradiction rule, because it needs the rendered page as
 * well as the events — a comparison, not an observation. Passive rules stay pure and run on every
 * window; this one costs a snapshot, so the agent asks for it.
 *
 * It exists because the misses that mattered on a real payments dashboard were all this shape: a USD
 * amount rendered with a rupee sign, a settlement the API calls `on_hold` rendered as "pending". No
 * request fails, no assertion fails, and the numbers on screen match the numbers in the payload. The
 * only thing that disagrees is the meaning.
