 * Wait, briefly, for the SDK to reconnect after a navigation — so `confirmed` can mean something.
 *
 * `window.location.assign(url)` destroys the SDK that would report on the new document, so the
 * navigation itself cannot be confirmed from inside the page. But the SDK reconnects TO THE DAEMON,
 * which makes the daemon the only party that can see arrival happen. Before this, it did not look,
 * and told the agent to poll `reticle_sessions` instead — a tool call on every navigation, on the
 * least reliable tool we ship.
 *
 * Bounded and best-effort by construction: a navigation to a page that is not instrumented, or not
 * there at all, must still return promptly with `confirmed:false` rather than hanging. The clock and
 * the sleep are injected so this is testable without waiting on a real one.
