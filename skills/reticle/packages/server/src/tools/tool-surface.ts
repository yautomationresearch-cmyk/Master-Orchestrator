/**
 * There is ONE tool surface. This is not a menu.
 *
 * The advertised tool DEFINITIONS are re-sent to the model on every turn, so the surface is a
 * per-turn cost that compounds across a loop, and fewer tools also makes the model wander less.
 * What ships is the verify loop (navigate→look→act→observe→assert, with direct network + console +
 * state) advertised directly, plus two meta-tools — `reticle_tools` to discover and `reticle_run` to
 * invoke — that keep every other tool exactly one call away. Nothing is unreachable; the cold tail
 * just is not re-sent every turn.
 *
 * Five profiles were tried. Four are gone, each for a measured reason rather than a taste:
 *
 * `core` was BYTE-IDENTICAL to the default — 16 tools, 18,183 bytes, the same list. One behaviour
 * behind two names is how "I set it and nothing changed" becomes a support question with no answer.
 *
 * `standard` advertised 17 more tools directly for ~3,500 extra tokens EVERY TURN, buying only the
 * removal of an occasional `reticle_run` hop. Nothing about that was characterisable as a use case.
 *
 * `dynamic` advertised the 2 meta-tools and nothing else. Not one harness, app or bench ever
 * selected it, and this repo's own measurement (bench/agent-loop-and-replay.md) says a pure
 * on-demand surface does NOT hold accuracy with a generic model: "it needs the hot-set schemas.
 * On-demand is for the cold tail, not the hot path." An option that is unused and measured-worse is
 * a trap, not a choice — it looks like a 4,000-token saving and costs correctness.
 *
 * ALL is what remains, and it is deliberately NOT a profile: it is a verification switch. It is the
 * only mode that advertises `outputSchema`, which is what makes the MCP layer validate tool OUTPUT —
 * the check that caught `reticle_verify_change` returning a payload its own schema rejected. It
 * cannot be folded into the default: measured, carrying output schemas on the 16-tool surface costs
 * 18,183 -> 41,117 bytes, 2.26x, +5,733 tokens per turn. And it cannot simply be deleted without
 * losing that defect class. So it stays, named for what it is, and no user is asked to pick it.
 *
 * Sizes are NOT restated here — not as a current figure, not as a historical one. Four generations
 * of this comment got them wrong. They live in surface-sizes.test.ts, which reads them off the real
 * surface. (The numbers above are the two measurements that JUSTIFY a decision, which is a different
 * job from documenting the current size; both were taken with a fresh daemon per reading.)

   * Measured on the wire: a verification that names its own target costs one `act_and_wait` call,
   * and 5,480 of its 5,909 tokens are the advertised surface re-sent for that single turn. The
   * answers cost 430. So on the path where the caller already knows what to assert, almost the
   * entire bill is the menu, and the menu is the thing to cut.
   *
   * Deliberately NOT the default, and now MEASURED rather than inherited. Run over the same 30-bug
   * set that the default surface scores 23/27 detection and 2/29 false alarms on:
   *
   *   detection      24/28   (held)
   *   FALSE ALARMS   7/30    (was 2/29 — TRIPLED)
   *   tokens         113,599 per run (was 179,959 — 37% cheaper)
   *
   * The five new false alarms are not scattered. They are `mutation-leak` and
   * `generate-blast-filter` (state), `kpi-deploys-tamper` (business-logic), `debounce-broken`
   * (timing) and `route-stuck-deployments` (routing) — precisely the classes whose evidence lives in
   * `reticle_state`, `reticle_network` and `reticle_observe`, which this surface does not advertise.
   * Strip the observation tools and the model stops observing: it reaches for the verdict without
   * the evidence and calls a healthy build broken.
   *
   * So the retired `dynamic` finding is confirmed, with a sharper mechanism than "accuracy drops".
   * 37% of the tokens is not worth trading for the one metric this product actually wins on, and
   * this must not become the default on the strength of the token number alone.
   *
   * It remains correct for a caller who has ALREADY decided what to assert — there the assertion
   * supplies the evidence the surface would otherwise have to go and find.
