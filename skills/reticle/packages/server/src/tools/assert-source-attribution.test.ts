/**
 * An assertion's `source` must describe the assertion's OWN evidence, or be absent.
 *
 * `reticle_assert` drives nothing, so `session.lastAct.source()` is whatever unrelated action ran
 * before it. Measured on a Next.js app: an assert on `{ role: 'navigation' }` whose evidence lived at
 * `ui/global-nav.tsx:54` was journaled as `app/page.tsx:22` — the previous CLICK's file — and an
 * assert that matched nothing at all was journaled the same way. Both are persisted into the session
 * journal and read back by `reticle_context`'s `proven`, so a wrong file:line outlives the turn that
 * produced it.
 *
 * The repo already holds this line in three other places (the instrumentation gap that refuses to
 * borrow the acted line, the undeclared-change gap that carries no source at all, the flow intent
 * that is never derived from step names): absence beats a wrong pointer, because a guessed pointer
 * costs the trip AND leaves the agent further from the code.
 *
 * The one borrow that stays is the documented one: a failure with no DOM element of its own — a
 * signal that never fired, a request never made — has nowhere else to point, and the control that
 * was last driven is where that handler lives. That is stated in the tool's own output schema.
