/**
 * Every `reticle_*` tool an e2e spec calls must still exist on the surface.
 *
 * This exists because the opposite happened and nothing noticed. A consolidation merged 56 tools down
 * to 41 — `reticle_record_start`/`_stop` became `reticle_record { action }`, `reticle_end_session`
 * became `reticle_session { action: 'end' }`, `reticle_flow_list` became `reticle_flow { action }` —
 * and four specs kept calling the old names. They died on `TOOLS.find(...)` returning undefined,
 * taking flow record/replay, self-heal, run history and live control with them, across bench-app AND
 * next-smoke. That is a whole framework's worth of coverage, dark for an unknown number of commits.
 *
 * It went unnoticed because the e2e battery needs three servers and ~8 minutes (measured; it was
 * documented as "~20 min" for months, and briefly as "~70s" — both wrong), so it is not in
 * `test:unit` — which is what actually runs. The battery cannot move into the unit gate, but the
 * failure mode that killed it is a name lookup, and a name lookup is checkable in milliseconds.
 *
 * So this is deliberately NOT an e2e test. It is a static cross-check placed in the gate that runs,
 * because the pattern in this repo is unambiguous: every rule a machine enforces has held, and every
 * rule left to prose has been violated. A renamed tool now fails here, in a second, instead of
 * silently deleting a spec's coverage.
