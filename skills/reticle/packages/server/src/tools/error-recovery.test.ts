/**
 * The SDK's own schema rejection arrives as a serialized zod ARRAY, and this is the one boundary
 * every agent-visible failure crosses — so it is where the array stops being the error text.
 *
 * `parsePredicate` fixed this for the three predicate tools by never producing the array. It cannot
 * help anywhere else: `action` on a merged tool is validated by the MCP SDK BEFORE our handler runs,
 * so the friendly "unknown action … expected: [tune, yield, …]" the handler already builds is
 * unreachable for the commonest mistake of all, calling `reticle_session` with no action. What the
 * agent got instead was the raw array. Driven live against the shipped daemon on `reticle_assert`.
 *
 * Fixing it HERE rather than per-tool is the point: one boundary, every tool, including ones nobody
 * has written yet.

 * boundary into "Missing required parameter for reticle_session: action (one of: …). Nothing ran."
 * That is strictly better prose than the field-level sentence produced downstream — it names the
 * TOOL and the allowed VALUES — and it was authored before the downstream formatter existed. It
