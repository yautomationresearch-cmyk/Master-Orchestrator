/**
 * Surface consolidation. Tool definitions are re-sent to the model EVERY turn, so the named-def
 * count is a per-turn tax multiplied by loop length. This merges a family of sibling tools
 * (`baseline_save`/`baseline_list`/`diff`) into one action-dispatched tool (`reticle_baseline {action}`)
 * WITHOUT rewriting any handler — each original handler is kept verbatim and selected by `action`, so a
 * merge cannot change behavior, only the advertised shape.
 *
 * The merged input schema is `{ action }` plus the union of the members' fields, each made optional
 * (different actions need different fields). Every handler already narrows its own args, so validation
 * strength is unchanged in practice.
 *
 * TRADEOFF (deliberate): a merged tool carries NO `outputSchema`, because its members return different
 * shapes and one schema cannot describe them. Schema-aware clients lose output validation for merged
 * families. That is why tools whose result contract matters — the 12-tool core hot-set, and hot verbs
 * like flow_replay/flow_verify/flow_heal that return their own documented verdict shapes — are NOT
 * merged. Only sibling families whose value is the capability, not the contract, are consolidated.
