/**
 * Both verdict paths must look at the same evidence for the same question.
 *
 * `reticle_act_and_wait` is the tool the product tells agents to reach for first — it is named in
 * the MCP handshake, in SKILL.md, and in the cheatsheet. `reticle_assert` is the other one. They
 * answer the same question and they were not reading the same inputs: `assert` passed `prior` to
 * the contradiction engine and `act_and_wait` did not.
 *
 * `prior` is what makes `unit-mismatch` possible — the money false green, where a total renders 100x
 * off because a value in minor units is displayed as major. A scale error disagrees with a value the
 * API stated EARLIER in the session, so an action-scoped window can never contain both halves. No
 * `prior`, no comparison, no finding.
 *
 * So the flagship detector could not fire on the flagship path, and nothing anywhere said so: the
 * finding was not suppressed or downgraded, it was simply never produced. That is the same shape as
 * the three wiring defects already fixed this release — a capability that exists, is tested, and
 * never reaches the caller.
 *
 * This pins the property rather than the plumbing: whatever the two paths pass, they must agree on
 * the inputs that decide which contradiction kinds are REACHABLE.
