/**
 * On-demand tool loading for MCP — the answer to the per-turn tool-definition tax.
 *
 * A normal MCP server advertises every tool's full description + schema, and the client re-sends
 * all of them to the model on EVERY turn. Measured here: Reticle at ~5.6k–14.6k tokens/turn just for
 * definitions, which dominates a real agent loop and only grows as the tool surface grows.
 *
 * The `dynamic` profile advertises just TWO meta-tools (~hundreds of tokens, fixed regardless of
 * how many real tools exist):
 * reticle_tools — discover. No args ⇒ a compact catalog (name + one-line summary) of every tool.
 * names:[...] ⇒ full description + params for just those tools, loaded on demand.
 * reticle_run — invoke any tool by name. On a bad/unknown call it returns that tool's params as a
 * hint, so the model self-corrects without ever needing the schema up front.
 *
 * The model lists once, loads the 2–3 tools it actually needs, and calls them — paying for tool
 * detail only when used, not every turn. Works with any MCP client (no client-side support needed).
