/**
 * Say that the look HAPPENED, when the look found nothing.
 *
 * A quiet page and a dead observer produce the same JSON: `[]`. Reported across seven tools in a
 * field sweep — network with 0 calls, console with 0 logs, reconcile comparing 0, crawl with 0 steps,
 * an empty message inbox — none of which could be told apart from the observer not working. Those
 * need opposite responses: one means "the app did nothing", the other means "stop trusting this run".
 *
 * One shared shape rather than a field per tool: an empty read states the window it watched. "I
 * watched 2000ms and saw nothing" is a finding. `[]` is an absence of information wearing the same
 * clothes as one.
