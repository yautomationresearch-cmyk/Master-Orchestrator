/**
 * Spend the budget you were given before reporting that you ran out of certainty.
 *
 * `waitForPredicate` resolves the instant the predicate holds. On an app that navigates
 * optimistically — which is normal, correct behaviour, and the norm on exactly the flows agents
 * verify most: login, submit, save — that instant arrives while the write is still in flight. The
 * verdict was then taken over a window the app had not finished writing, and came back
 * `unknown / unsettled` with a recovery note asking the CALLER to re-check.
 *
 * Measured on the most common flow there is: a login that genuinely succeeded returned at 492ms out
 * of an 8000ms budget. The declared signal had fired with matching data, state had moved from
 * anonymous to authenticated, the token was in storage, honesty grade was `signal` and capture
 * integrity was clean. Seven and a half seconds of authorised waiting went unused, and the agent was
 * handed a shrug.
 *
 * A false NEGATIVE is not the mirror of a false positive here. A false positive stops an agent early;
 * a false negative makes it redo work that already succeeded, and — far worse — teaches it to
 * discount the verdict channel. The verdict channel is the entire product, and an agent that learns
 * to ignore `unknown` will ignore the true ones too.
 *
 * What this does NOT do is decide the request succeeded. At 492ms nobody can know that, and inventing
 * a green here would be the exact defect this product exists to prevent. It waits for the answer
 * rather than guessing at it:
 *
 *   - everything settles → the normal contradiction machinery sees the real responses, so a failure
 *     still contradicts and a success no longer looks like an absence;
 *   - still in flight when the budget genuinely runs out → `unsettled`, as before, but now an honest
 *     limit instead of an early exit.
