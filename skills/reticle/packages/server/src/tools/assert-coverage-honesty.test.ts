/**
 * A green verdict must never imply more coverage than the SDK actually had.
 *
 * `reticle_act_and_wait` has always carried a coverage statement, so a cross-origin iframe or a closed
 * shadow root downgrades its verdict to `partial`. Plain `reticle_assert` did not — and assert is the
 * cheaper, more-used verdict path, the one an agent gates on. So on a page with an unobservable
 * region, a passing assert read as "the page is correct" when the only honest claim available was
 * "nothing failed in the part I could see". That is the exact false-green shape this project exists to
 * prevent, sitting on the most-travelled route.
 *
 * The field stays OMITTED at full coverage: its PRESENCE is the warning, so emitting it always would
 * make it noise on every healthy call and it would stop being read.
