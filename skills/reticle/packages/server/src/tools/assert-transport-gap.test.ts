/**
 * A window the browser dropped events in must not grade `proved`.
 *
 * `RATE_LIMITED` — the BRIDGE sampling because events arrived faster than its per-second cap — is
 * already the one blind spot that `impeachesCapture`, on the reasoning that a green over a window
 * you did not fully see "would only describe what was observed". `TRANSPORT_OVERFLOW` is the exact
 * same loss on the other side of the wire: the browser's own queue overflowed and threw events
 * away. It was read in journal rollups and nowhere on the verdict path, so the identical condition
 * downgraded a verdict from one side of the socket and was invisible from the other.
 *
 * This is the gap-marker half of #117: the SDK knows it lost events, and none of that reached the
 * rule that decides whether a green can be trusted.
