/**
 * Every integration we SHIP has an app that exercises it, and a gate that runs that app.
 *
 * This is the rule `apps/` never stated, which is why it accumulated: apps arrived for a reason and
 * then nothing recorded whether that reason was still being served. The Astro and Remix examples
 * wire the SDK for real (Astro connects a different way, because it SSRs its own HTML so the
 * plugin's index.html injection never fires) and are driven by the integration battery — which is
 * why they can be offered in SKILL.md at all.
 *
 * The failure mode this prevents is shipping a broken integration, and discipline does not prevent it
 * — a red build does. Adding `packages/svelte` with no app and no spec fails here, at the moment the
 * package is added, rather than in a user's bug report.
 *
 * A thin app is CORRECT for this job: `electron-smoke` is 290 lines because its job is to prove the
 * wiring works, not to be an application. Size is not the measure; coverage is.
