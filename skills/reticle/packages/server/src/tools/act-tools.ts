This tool returns immediately with a `since` cursor; observe the reaction yourself with reticle_observe. Use it for actions with no observable consequence to assert (focus, hover, scrollIntoView, a fill you are about to submit). One action against a ref: click|dblclick|hover|focus|fill|type|clear|select|check|uncheck|submit|press|scrollIntoView. Carries effect:{dispatched,targetMatched,visible,enabled,focusMoved,valueChanged,domMutatedWithin,occluded,occludedBy,scrolledIntoView} to tell "action missed" from "app didn\'t react"; dispatched=landed, settled=a real frame flushed, and a settle timeout never fails the tool. Fields at their uninformative default are OMITTED so a clean action collapses to its consequence: an absent dispatched/targetMatched/visible/enabled means true, an absent occluded/scrolledIntoView/valueChanged/defaultPrevented means false, an absent focusMoved/occludedBy means null. occluded=true means the click point is covered by another element (a real user could not click it) — synthetic dispatch still delivered the event; scrolledIntoView=true means an off-viewport target was scrolled in first. effect.alreadyAtValue=true (check/uncheck only) means the box already read as the requested state, so NOTHING was dispatched and the app was never told — the DOM property is not evidence the application holds that value, so assert the app\'s own state (a signal, a request, a derived control), not the box. inputMode is "real" (native CDP, no synthetic effect block) or "synthetic"; clicks default to the occlusion-honest synthetic path even when CDP is configured — pass args.native:true to force a trusted native click (file pickers, clipboard). args.holdMs keeps the pointer DOWN for that long between mousedown and mouseup — the only way to drive a hold-to-confirm control (hold-to-delete, hold-to-record, long-press); effect.heldMs reports the hold actually achieved, which a throttled background tab can stretch. args.confirmDangerous is a permission gate and NOT a duration: it allows a destructive control, it does not hold one. inputModeReason explains any real→synthetic choice so it is never silent.
