/**
 * Spend the budget you were given before reporting that you ran out of certainty.
 *
 * A login that genuinely succeeds is the most common flow an agent verifies, and it came back
 * `verified:"unknown" / unsettled` — with the declared signal fired AND its data matching, app state
 * moved from anonymous to authenticated, the auth token written to storage, honesty grade `signal`
 * (our strongest evidence class) and capture integrity clean. The single dissenting observation was
 * that the POST had not come back yet.
 *
 * The tool had 8000ms of budget and returned at 492ms. `waitForPredicate` resolves the instant the
 * predicate holds, so the verdict is taken while the app is still mid-flight, and the answer is a
 * shrug the caller then has to resolve by hand — the recovery text literally says "re-check". Seven
 * and a half seconds of authorised waiting went unused.
 *
 * Note what this deliberately does NOT do. It never turns an unsettled request into a pass by
 * assumption: the app navigates optimistically, so at 492ms nobody can know whether that POST
 * succeeds. It waits for the answer instead of guessing at it. A request that comes back a FAILURE
 * still contradicts — that is the real false green and it has to keep working — and a request that is
 * still in flight when the budget genuinely runs out still reports unsettled, which is now an honest
 * limit rather than an early exit.
