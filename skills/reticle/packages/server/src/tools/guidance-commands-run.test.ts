/**
 * The commands the PRODUCT tells a stuck user to run are executed against the shipped parser too.
 *
 * `docs-commands-run` already does this for every `.md` in the repo, and stops there. But the most
 * consequential instructions Reticle gives are not in the docs — they are in string constants: the
 * MCP handshake block that opens "no app has ever connected", the no-session diagnosis, the refusal
 * recoveries, the framework recipes `init` prints, the line `doctor` ends on. That text is what
 * somebody reads at the exact moment nothing is working, and it is the text nobody re-reads once it
 * is written.
 *
 * So a renamed flag or a retired subcommand there is worse than the same mistake in a doc. A doc has
 * a reader who can go and look something up; this has a reader who has already established that
 * things are broken, and hands them a command that errors. That is the moment somebody stops.
 *
 * `parseCliArgs` is the real oracle, the same one `cli.ts` calls and the same one the docs guard
 * uses: pure, no daemon, no network, and it returns an error for an unknown command or an unknown
 * argument.
