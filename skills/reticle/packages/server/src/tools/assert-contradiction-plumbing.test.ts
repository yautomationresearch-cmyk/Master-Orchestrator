/**
 * `reticle_assert` must SURFACE a contradiction, not merely be able to find one.
 *
 * Found by mutation: replacing `findContradictions(...)` with `[]` inside `assertVerdict` failed
 * ZERO tests — while gutting `findContradictions` ITSELF fails 23. The detector is thoroughly
 * covered; the wire from it into the tool an agent actually calls was bare.
 *
 * This is the flagship behaviour of the product, and it was verified by hand tonight against the
 * `swallowed-500-generate` fixture — UI renders success, the wire returned 500:
 *
 *   pass: true, verified: "no", verifiedReason: "contradicted",
 *   contradictions: [{ claim: 'the app fired "compose:generated"',
 *                      counter: "1 request(s) in the same window failed",
 *                      detail: "POST /api/generate-script → 500" }]
 *
 * `pass:true` with `verified:"no"` IS the product. Had that plumbing regressed, every one of those
 * verdicts would have silently become a clean green and no test would have said a word.
 *
 * Third instance of one pattern in three passes (see #227 occludedBy, #228 bufferHealth): a
 * well-tested producer, consumers that stub it, and nothing on the delegation between them.
