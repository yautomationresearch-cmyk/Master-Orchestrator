/**
 * A verdict whose window LOST events must not grade `proved` — and one whose window lost nothing
 * must not be caveated for evictions that happened elsewhere.
 *
 * `act_and_wait` marks its window truncated with `session.lostSince(since)`. That feeds
 * `integrity.issues`, and `!integrity.clean` is what makes `decideVerified` answer UNCLEAN_CAPTURE:
 * "a green here would only describe what was observed".
 *
 * Found by mutation: hardcoding that flag to `false` failed ZERO tests. So a verdict reached over a
 * window the server buffer had evicted during would have come back `proved`, with no trace that
 * part of the window was never seen.
 *
 * The flag stuck ON is the opposite failure and, in the field, the more expensive one: it read the
 * cumulative drop counter, which moves on every push once a session is a minute old, so verdicts
 * came back `unknown` over windows that were completely intact. The cursor is asserted below for
 * that reason — the whole defect was a consumer asking the buffer a question about the session when
 * it meant to ask one about the window.
 *
 * Distinct from the Session-level gap (`Session.lostSince` delegating to the ring buffer, covered
 * separately): this is act_and_wait's USE of it, and it had its own hole.
