/**
 * A delta the agent cannot act on is not a saving, it is a second call.
 *
 * `reticle_snapshot { diff: true }` cuts real tokens — the cost regression asserts the delta stays
 * under a tenth of a full re-read — but every delta line came back as `- button "Row actions"` with
 * no ref. Acting needs a ref, so the full snapshot had to be taken anyway and the diff call bought
 * nothing. Measured on a filter that removed 26 of 36 controls, `interactive` cost 390 tokens WITH
 * refs and `interactive + diff` cost 275 WITHOUT them: strictly worse, because the 275 was spent and
 * then the 390 was spent too.
 *
 * The cause is one helper with two callers and opposite requirements. `normalizeLines` strips the ref
 * marker deliberately — a ref in a stored baseline would make every later diff noisy — and the delta
 * path reuses it wholesale. So the fix is not to change `normalizeLines`, which is right for
 * baselines; it is for the delta path to diff on the ref-stripped key while EMITTING the original
 * line. Identity for comparison, ref for action.
 *
 * The same split fixes the second half. Focus state rides in the line (`[focused]`, or inside a
 * comma-joined bracket), so moving focus made one line appear in `removed` and its twin in `added` —
 * in the measured case 100% of the "added" entries were this, reported as structural change when
 * nothing had been added at all. Focus is a property OF a line, not a line coming or going, so it
 * belongs on its own field.
