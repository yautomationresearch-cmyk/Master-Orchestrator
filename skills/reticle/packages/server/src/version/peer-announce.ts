/**
 * How another Reticle PROCESS announces itself to the daemon.
 *
 * The SDK announces in HELLO and the CLI reads /status, but the MCP server an agent spawns had no
 * announcement at all — and it is the piece the user actually hits: `npx @reticlehq/server mcp`
 * resolves from a cache, so an agent can be running a months-old MCP package against a current
 * daemon with nothing anywhere saying so.
 *
 * It rides the SSE connect the proxy already makes, as two query params. Query params rather than a
 * new message because the connection happens before any protocol exchange, and because an older
 * proxy that sends neither is handled correctly by describeSkew (absent contract + differing version
 * = a build that predates the field).
