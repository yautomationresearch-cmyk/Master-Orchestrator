/**
 * Skew has to reach the AGENT, on whatever tool it happens to be calling.
 *
 * Reticle is three independently-installed pieces that talk to each other: the SDK in the page, the
 * daemon holding the bridge, and the MCP server the agent spawns. They are versioned separately and
 * upgraded separately, so any pair can drift — and each pair fails the same silent way, since the
 * wire protocol still matches and only BEHAVIOUR disagrees.
 *
 * Every check built so far reported into a place nobody looks: SDK skew landed in
 * `reticle_sessions.versionSkew`, which an agent driving a flow never calls, and daemon skew went to
 * a CLI log line no agent reads. So an agent could work for an entire session against a mismatched
 * pair, see tools behave oddly, and never be told the one fact that explains it.
 *
 * This is the delivery channel: skew rides out on the NEXT tool result, whatever that tool is —
 * the same reasoning the update nudge already uses ("an out-of-date install is worth mentioning
 * whatever the agent is doing"). Once per distinct message, so a long session is told, not nagged.
