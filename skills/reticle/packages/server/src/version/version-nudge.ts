/**
 * Getting skew in front of the AGENT, on whatever tool it happens to be calling.
 *
 * Every check built before this reported into a place nobody looks: SDK skew landed in
 * `reticle_sessions.versionSkew`, which an agent driving a flow never calls, and daemon skew went to
 * a CLI log line no agent reads. So an agent could work an entire session against a mismatched pair,
 * watch tools behave oddly, and never be told the one fact that explains it.
 *
 * This is the delivery channel — the same one the update nudge uses, for the same reason: an
 * out-of-date install is worth mentioning whatever the agent is doing. It rides out on the next tool
 * result, then goes quiet until the skew CHANGES. Told, not nagged: a banner on every call is one an
 * agent learns to skip, and it would cost those tokens on every call for the rest of the session.
