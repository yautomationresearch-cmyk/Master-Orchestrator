/**
 * A 2.2.1 SDK against a 2.4.0 daemon agrees on `protocolVersion`, connects fine, and then disagrees
 * about tool behaviour — which surfaced to a user as a bare `-32000` with nothing on either side
 * naming a version. It took a stale pnpm metadata cache to produce, was invisible to everyone, and
 * the only reason we know the shape of it is that someone hit it and reported the symptom.
 *
 * The point is that skew SAYS SO. Silence is the failure mode being fixed — but so is crying wolf:
 * a warning that fires on every harmless patch difference is one nobody reads by the third time.

 *
 * The behaviour is already right. What was missing is anything holding it there: the delivery test
 * beside this one asserts the SDK version reaches the agent and never checks that the DAEMON's does.
 * "Your SDK is 2.4.0" is half an answer — it does not say which direction the skew runs or how far,
 * which is the part that decides whether you upgrade the app or the CLI.
 *
 * A characterisation test, not a fix. Its worth is that it fails if a future reword drops one of the
 * two numbers, which is the cheapest way for this to regress and the hardest to notice: the sentence
 * would still read fluently.
