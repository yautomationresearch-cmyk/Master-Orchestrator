/**
 * `reticle_verify_change` — the regression loop in one call.
 *
 * The agent's real question after an edit is "did I break anything", and answering it took four
 * tools it had to know to chain: work out which saved flows the diff invalidates, replay that
 * subset, then separately go looking for contradictions and untouched controls. Every piece already
 * existed; nothing composed them, so the loop was only run by an agent that already knew the recipe.
 *
 * The honesty guard is the whole design. NO FLOWS COVERING A CHANGE IS `unknown`, NEVER `yes` —
 * "nothing ran" and "everything passed" are the same green to anyone reading a boolean, and treating
 * an uncovered change as verified is the exact false green this project exists to remove. `cli-verify`
 * already refuses to return a green pass with no flows; this applies the same rule on the MCP side.
