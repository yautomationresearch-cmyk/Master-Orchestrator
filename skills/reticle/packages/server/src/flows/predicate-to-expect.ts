/**
 * The assertion the agent MADE, in the shape a saved flow can keep.
 *
 * `reticle_act_and_wait { until }` is how agents assert — 12 of 14 calls in a day of telemetry
 * carried an `until`. `compileActStep` recorded only the ACTION, so a flow saved after an asserted
 * drive came back graded `assertion-free`: "performs actions but asserts no observable consequence —
 * it will pass even if the feature is broken." The agent had already said what success meant;
 * Reticle discarded it and then warned the agent that the flow asserts nothing.
 *
 * That is the regression-suite story failing at its last step. "Record once, verify forever" is only
 * worth anything if the recorded flow can go RED, and locally 32 of 39 saved flows cannot.
 *
 * The inverse of `successToPredicate`. Only the kinds FlowExpect can express are carried: `settled`
 * is a wait rather than a claim, and `route`/`animation`/`anyOf`/`not` have no representation at all.
 * Inventing one would write an assertion into the file that the agent never made, which is worse
 * than recording none — a flow that asserts something nobody chose is a false green with extra steps.

/**
 * The subset a REPLAY actually enforces today.

 * `flow-replay` checks exactly two things per step: `expect.element.testid` is present after the
 * action, and `expect.state` holds. A recorded `net` or `signal` expect is graded as a consequence
 * assertion by `classifyFlowAssertions` and then never evaluated — so writing one into a flow file
 * would make it report `grade: "asserted"` while nothing checks it.
 *
 * That is a false green, in the feature whose entire purpose is preventing them, produced by the
 * change that was meant to strengthen it. So only the enforced kinds are recorded: a flow that says
 * it asserts something must actually go red when that thing breaks.
 *
 * Lifting this is worth doing — net and signal are the assertions agents most often make, and the
 * conversion above already handles them — but it requires replay to evaluate them per step (the
 * machinery exists: successToPredicate + the predicate engine). Until then, recording them would
 * trade a weak flow for a lying one.
