 * A replay used to report only in the language of the DOM: step 3 drifted, this assertion failed.
 * True, actionable, and illegible — the reader still had to reconstruct what stopped working. The
 * ledger in `.reticle/intent.json` already holds the other half (prose statements, declared → bound
 * → proved, and the verdict that discharged each one), so a flow does not need its own notion of
 * intent. It needs an id.
 *
 * Nothing here derives an intent from step names. A flow that declares none reports that it declares
 * none — a guessed intent puts words in the product owner's mouth and an agent will act on them,
 * which is strictly worse than the honest absence.
