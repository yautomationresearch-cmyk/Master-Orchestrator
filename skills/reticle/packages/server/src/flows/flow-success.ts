/**
 * Evaluate a flow's `success` end-condition — "green means intent satisfied".
 *
 * This is the one piece replay does NOT do per-step: turn a flow's success FlowExpect into a
 * Predicate and assert it with the SAME waitForPredicate engine the tools/replay use. A signal/net
 * success is a real CONSEQUENCE — a locator healed to the wrong element cannot fake it, so it
 * catches the regression self-healing tools ship green (mabl/qate.ai). The dynamic skip-set is
 * honored exactly as in replay: a success bound to a dynamic (LLM-output) testid is presence-only,
 * never asserted, so the skip is symmetric across the step layer and the success layer.
 *
 * Lives in reticle-server (alongside the predicate engine) so BOTH the live MCP `reticle_flow_replay`
 * tool and the `@reticlehq/test` spec runner share one implementation — no divergent oracle.
 * Pure: no IO, no clock.
