/**
 * Accrue a suite run's outcomes into the flake ledger, and report what the ledger knows.
 *
 * This existed twice — once in `flow_verify`'s sequential branch and once, after #240, in its
 * parallel branch. That duplication is not incidental: the parallel branch shipped WITHOUT it, so an
 * agent verifying in parallel built no flake evidence at all and never saw the quarantine set, and
 * nothing went red because the other copy was still correct. One function both branches call is what
 * makes that miss impossible on one side only.
 *
 * It is also what makes the behaviour testable. The handler itself needs a live browser session, so
 * both branches were only ever pinned by tests that RE-IMPLEMENTED this loop — which passed with the
 * shipped code reverted (measured on #240: 4/4 green with the fix absent). Extracted, the real thing
 * runs in a unit test.
 *
 * Best-effort on both halves, deliberately: a flake ledger is memory, not a gate. A full disk must
 * never turn a working verification into an error.
