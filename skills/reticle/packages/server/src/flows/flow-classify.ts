/**
 * Classify whether a flow asserts an observable CONSEQUENCE or is "assertion-free" / presence-only.
 *
 * Why this exists (grounded in real testing behavior):
 * - Martin Fowler, *Assertion-Free Testing*: teams hit 100% coverage with tests that "weren't any
 * assertions" — green, but verifying nothing.
 * - Kent C. Dodds, *Make Your Test Fail*: a test that doesn't fail when you break the code gives
 * false security.
 * - Self-healing vendors (mabl, qate.ai) admit a locator healed to the WRONG element makes a test
 * pass green while a real regression ships — but only if the test merely checks presence.
 * - AI agents agree with human pass/fail only ~68% of the time (arXiv 2510.02418), so the flow
 * itself must carry a real oracle, not rely on the agent eyeballing success.
 *
 * For a flow, an FlowExpect can assert a `signal` (app emitted an event), a `net` call, or just an
 * `element` presence. signal/net are OBSERVABLE CONSEQUENCES — they can't be satisfied by a wrong
 * element. element-only is WEAK — a healed-but-wrong locator can still satisfy it. A flow with no
 * expect on any step and no success end-condition asserts nothing at all.
 *
 * Pure: no IO, no clock.

 * reported `grade: "asserted"` and could not go red. `assertStepExpect` closed that by compiling
 * every step expect through the same `successToPredicate` the flow-level path uses, so the narrow
