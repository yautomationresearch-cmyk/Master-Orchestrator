/**
 * `reticle_affected` — which saved flows must re-verify for a set of changed files.
 *
 * This logic already existed as `reticle affected`, deliberately kept off the MCP surface because an
 * advertised tool costs tokens on every turn whether or not it is used. That reasoning is right, and
 * this does not change it: the tool is NOT advertised by any profile. It is reachable through
 * `reticle_run`, so it costs nothing per turn and is still discoverable via `reticle_tools`.
 *
 * What the reasoning missed is who holds the question. The AGENT is the one that just edited files
 * and has to decide what to re-check; a shell command it may not be able to run is not an answer for
 * an MCP client that has no shell. Leaving it CLI-only meant the party with the diff could not ask
 * the party with the index.
 *
 * Unknown-provenance flows are returned as affected (fail-safe) AND listed separately, so "re-verify
 * this" is never confused with "this definitely touches your change".
