 * computed nearest testid) into a concrete, confidence-scored rebind. No new heuristics enter the
 * trust boundary: confidence is derived only from the existing case-insensitive edit distance, so
 * the "never silently rewrite a bad guess" invariant lives in a single numeric floor
 * (HEAL_CONFIDENCE_MIN). Separated from the reticle_flow_heal tool so it is unit-testable without a
 * live session or the filesystem.
 *
 * FIRST CUT: testid-anchor rebinds only, scored by string distance.
 * Future: rebind by alternate anchors (role+name, signal correlation); multi-candidate
 * ranking when several testids tie; confidence beyond string distance (DOM-position / a11y-role
 * agreement, contract-diff awareness); healing degraded (ROLE-unresolved) steps; signal-drift
 * healing (signals have no nearest-match today — intentionally nearest:null, no proposal).
