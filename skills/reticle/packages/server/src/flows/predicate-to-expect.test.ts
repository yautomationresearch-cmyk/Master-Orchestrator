/**
 * Carrying the assertion an agent MADE into the flow it saved.
 *
 * `reticle_act_and_wait { until }` is how agents assert — 12 of the 14 calls in a day of telemetry
 * carried an `until`. But `compileActStep` recorded only the ACTION, so a flow saved after an
 * asserted drive came back graded `assertion-free`: "performs actions but asserts no observable
 * consequence — it will pass even if the feature is broken."
 *
 * The agent had already said what success meant. Reticle threw it away and then warned the agent
 * that the flow asserts nothing.
 *
 * That is the whole regression-suite story failing at the last step: "record once, verify forever"
 * produces a suite of flows that cannot go red. Locally, 32 of 39 saved flows are assertion-free.
 *
 * Only the kinds FlowExpect can express are carried. `settled`, `route`, `animation`, `anyOf` and
 * `not` have no representation, and inventing one would put an assertion in the file that the agent
 * never made — worse than recording nothing.
