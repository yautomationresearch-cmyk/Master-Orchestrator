 * Reticle's Electron preload shim. Add ONE line at the top of your preload, before you expose
 * anything:
 *
 *     require('@reticlehq/electron/preload');
 *
 * ...and every `ipcRenderer.invoke`, `sendSync` and `send` your app makes becomes a Reticle-visible
 * request (`ipc://<channel>`), so net assertions and settle-waiting cover the main-process hop.
 * A one-way `send` is recorded as DISPATCHED with no outcome, because that is all the renderer knows.
 *
 * Why a preload shim and not renderer-side patching, like every other Reticle observer:
 * `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` hands the renderer a DEEPLY FROZEN object, installed on `window`
 * as non-writable AND non-configurable. Neither assignment nor defineProperty can replace a method on
 * it — verified, not assumed. The renderer physically cannot instrument an app's IPC surface. The
 * preload is the last point where the functions are still ordinary and writable.
 *
 * This file is hand-written CommonJS on purpose: a sandboxed Electron preload is CJS-only and cannot
 * load the ESM SDK build.
 *
 * Dev-only, like the rest of Reticle. Gate the require behind your dev check so it never ships.
