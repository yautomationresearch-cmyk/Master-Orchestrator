 * Why the main process: `webContents.capturePage()` reads the window's own BACKING STORE. That makes
 * it correct while the window is behind your editor, correct while it is backgrounded, and free of
 * any screen-recording permission. Capturing a screen region instead was tried and rejected — it
 * photographs whatever is on top, which would quietly save a picture of your editor as a visual
 * baseline. Renderer-side capture is not an option either: the renderer has no access to the pixels.
 *
 * Dev-only, like the rest of Reticle. Gate the require behind your dev check so it never ships.

 * sits there, and a symlink pre-placed at that name would have `writeFile` follow it and write

 * made it. Guessing is not the property that matters; the shared parent was.
