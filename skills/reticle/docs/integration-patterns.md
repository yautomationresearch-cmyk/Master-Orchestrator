The recommended shape for a real codebase is three decisions: put `createReticleEmitter()` in one `app/emit.ts` so components depend on an interface and `@reticlehq/browser` never reaches your production bundle; emit signals from the **store layer** rather than from N call sites; and let each feature self-register its testids and signals with `registerReticleDomain`. Then turn on `reticle/require-signal-on-mutation` so the signal layer cannot silently rot.

The basics in [Getting Started](getting-started.md) work with **zero app changes**. This doc is the _recommended_ shape for a real codebase: a minimal production footprint, a signal layer that can't silently drift, and an adoption path that starts paying off on day one, with no rewrite required.

## 1. Start here: reuse what you already have

Adoption is **free → cheap → targeted**. You don't instrument everything; you reuse what you have, then add the handful of facts the DOM can't express.

**1. Reuse your existing `data-testid` (free).** If you already test with Playwright or Cypress, your testids work in Reticle unchanged; `reticle_query({ by: 'testid', value: 'checkout' })` matches them exactly. No new markup, no new code.

**2. Advertise the surface from your existing constants (cheap).** You already keep a `TestIds` constant object for your E2E suite. Pass it straight in. Now `reticle_capabilities()` tells a fresh agent your whole surface without reading source.

```ts
import { registerCapabilities } from '@reticlehq/browser';
import { TestIds } from '../e2e/test-ids'; // the same constants your Playwright suite uses

registerCapabilities({
  testids: Object.values(TestIds),
  signals: ['order:saved'],
  stores: ['cart'],
});
```

**3. Add signals only at the ~20 commit points that matter (targeted).** Emit `reticle.signal(name, data)` at the moments the DOM can't show: a save committed, a webhook arrived, an edit applied, an async generation finished. You instrument the off-DOM facts you'd otherwise eyeball, not every line.

```ts
import { reticle } from '@reticlehq/browser';
onSaved(() => reticle.signal('order:saved', { id, total }));
// agent: reticle_assert({ predicate: { kind: 'signal', name: 'order:saved', dataMatches: { id: '*' } } })
```

That's day-one usefulness with no rewrite. The rest of this doc is how to do steps 2 and 3 _well_ so the signal layer stays honest as the app grows.

## 2. Inject the emitter (zero prod bundle)

The #1 objection: _"I don't want a test tool in my production bundle."_ The answer: components never import `@reticlehq/browser`. They depend on a tiny structural interface, `ReticleEmitter` (`{ signal, state }`), and the real emitter is injected once at the top. `createReticleEmitter()` returns an emitter that proxies to the connected `reticle` singleton and is a **safe no-op** until `reticle.connect()` runs, so nothing breaks in production or before connect, and **`@reticlehq/browser` stays out of the prod bundle.**

```ts
// app/emit.ts: the one place that touches @reticlehq/browser
import { createReticleEmitter } from '@reticlehq/browser';
export const emit = createReticleEmitter(); // no-op until reticle.connect()
```

```ts
// any component: depends on the interface, not the SDK
import { emit } from '../emit';
function onSaved(id: string, total: number) {
  emit.signal('order:saved', { id, total });
}
```

The emitter re-checks the connection on every call, so you can create it at module load (before `reticle.connect()`) and it starts forwarding the moment Reticle connects. (See [getting-started Step 2](getting-started.md#step-2-embed-the-sdk-in-your-app) for where `reticle.connect()` goes.) This is the single highest-leverage decision; everything below assumes it.

## 3. Emit signals from the store layer, not N call sites

The smell: every store mutation hand-emits a signal right after it, and over dozens of call sites the two **drift**: a new mutation path forgets the emit and the contract silently breaks. Drive the signal from where the state actually changes instead.

**Pattern A: store middleware (sketch).** One audited map from action → signal lives next to the store, so _state changed ⇒ signal fired_ is structural, not a thing each call site remembers.

```ts
// store-with-reticle.ts sketch: one audited transition map, not N call sites
import { emit } from './emit';

const signalFor: Record<string, (next: State) => readonly [string, Record<string, unknown>]> = {
  reorderSections: (s) => ['section:reordered', { order: s.order }],
  addSection: (s) => ['section:added', { count: s.sections.length }],
};

function dispatch(action: keyof typeof signalFor, run: () => State): void {
  const next = run();
  const make = signalFor[action];
  if (make !== undefined) emit.signal(...make(next));
}
```

**Pattern B: `commitAndSignal` (lighter).** When you don't want a middleware, pair the mutation and its signal in one call that can't drift. It runs `mutate()`, emits the signal exactly once, and returns the mutation's value.

```ts
import { commitAndSignal } from '@reticlehq/browser';
import { emit } from '../emit';

const next = commitAndSignal(
  emit,
  () => store.reorderSections(fromId, toId),
  'section:reordered',
  deriveOrder(store.getState()),
);
```

If `mutate` throws, the mutation never happened, so **the signal is not emitted and the error propagates** unchanged.

> **The documented exception:** genuinely view-level signals (render or async completions like `diff:shown` or `caption:generated`, which aren't store state) legitimately stay in your components. Only commit-point signals belong in the store layer.

Pair this with store registration so the agent can _read_ state instead of you emitting a signal per fact: `registerStore('workspace', useWorkspace)`, then `reticle_state({ store: 'workspace' })`.

## 4. Self-registering domains (`registerReticleDomain`)

Rather than maintaining one central flat-map of the whole testable surface (and remembering to wire each new area into it), co-locate one `reticle.ts` per domain that exports its `{ testids, signals, stores }` and self-registers. The capability registry assembles itself from every domain; later calls accumulate as a union, with no duplicates.

```ts
// features/sections/reticle.ts: co-locate a domain's testids + signals in one module
import { registerReticleDomain } from '@reticlehq/browser';

export const SectionTestIds = { list: 'section-list', add: 'section-add' } as const;
export const SectionSignals = { reordered: 'section:reordered' } as const;

registerReticleDomain({
  testids: Object.values(SectionTestIds),
  signals: Object.values(SectionSignals),
  stores: ['workspace'],
});
```

```ts
// features/search/reticle.ts
import { registerReticleDomain } from '@reticlehq/browser';
registerReticleDomain({ testids: ['search-input'], signals: ['search:ran'] });
```

Importing both modules in dev makes `reticle_capabilities()` return the merged surface (`testids: ['section-list', 'section-add', 'search-input']`, `signals: ['section:reordered', 'search:ran']`, `stores: ['workspace']`). `registerReticleDomain` is a thin convenience over `registerCapabilities`, with the same merge-idempotent, HMR-safe semantics, so it composes with §1's "use your existing constants." (Named flows stay an explicit `registerCapabilities({ flows })` concern: their last-writer-wins semantics don't fit "accumulate from many domains.")

## 5. Keep the signal layer from rotting (`@reticlehq/eslint-plugin`)

A signal layer silently rots: someone adds a mutation path and forgets the signal, and the agent's contract breaks with no error. The lint rule catches it at the only moment that's cheap: review.

The rule **`reticle/require-signal-on-mutation`** flags a function that calls a configured store mutator but emits no signal in the same function. It is a **safe no-op until you tell it which calls mutate state** (`mutators`) and which call emits a signal (`signalCallee`, default `signal` / `reticleSignal`):

```js
// eslint.config.js (flat config)
import reticle from '@reticlehq/eslint-plugin';

export default [
  {
    plugins: { reticle },
    rules: {
      'reticle/require-signal-on-mutation': [
        'warn',
        { mutators: ['set', 'reorderSections', 'addSection'], signalCallee: 'signal' },
      ],
    },
  },
];
```

Or turn it on with the shipped preset: `plugin.configs.recommended`, which sets `reticle/require-signal-on-mutation` to `warn` (with empty no-op defaults you then configure) and the plugin's other rule, `reticle/no-internal-tags`, to `error`. A function that calls a mutator and a signal together passes; a mutator with no signal reports `store mutation without a mapped Reticle signal`. The documented view-level exceptions from §3 simply don't list those view callees as `mutators`, so they never fire.

## 6. Limitation: un-scriptable tabs, use `reticle drive`

Reticle observes and drives a tab through the in-page SDK plus (optionally) CDP. It **cannot bring to front or recover a browser tab the OS won't let it script**: a backgrounded tab, say, or a non-default browser (Dia, etc.) reporting `hidden:true` / `throttled:true`.

When that happens, `reticle_sessions` and every act/assert result carry a `session.recommendation` saying so. The escape hatch is **`reticle drive <url>`** (add `--headed` to watch). Reticle launches and owns a guaranteed-scriptable browser. See [usage §18](usage.md#18-real-input-mode-native-hover--drag) for the full note.

## Checklist

- [ ] One `app/emit.ts` is the **only** module importing `@reticlehq/browser`; components import the emitter.
- [ ] `reticle.connect()` is dev-gated; the prod bundle has no `@reticlehq/browser`.
- [ ] Signals fire from the store layer (middleware or `commitAndSignal`); view-level exceptions are explicit.
- [ ] Each domain self-registers via `registerReticleDomain`; `reticle_capabilities()` returns the full surface.
- [ ] Existing Playwright/Cypress testids are reused, not duplicated.
- [ ] `reticle/require-signal-on-mutation` is enabled with your `mutators` + `signalCallee`.
- [ ] The team knows `reticle drive <url>` for un-scriptable tabs.
