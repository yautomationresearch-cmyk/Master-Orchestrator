Many agents can drive the same app at once without a browser each: `reticle_lease {action:"acquire"}` hands each one an **isolated context** (its own cookies, storage and DOM) from a single shared headless Chromium. One daemon per machine, and identity is the **app** (a stable `projectId` stamped by the build plugin), not the port, so an app that boots on `:3001` today is still the same app.

Reticle is built for the messy real world: several apps running at once, ports that shift between runs, and many agents driving different flows of the same app in parallel, without each one spinning up its own Chromium. This page explains how that works and how to use it.

## The mental model

- **One daemon per machine.** `reticle mcp` discovers a running daemon (via `~/.reticle`) or starts one. A crashed daemon's stale pidfile is reclaimed automatically, so you never chase "port already in use" or a zombie server.
- **Identity is the app, not the port.** The build plugin stamps a stable `projectId` that travels in every connection. If your Next app usually runs on `:3000` but boots on `:3001` today, Reticle still knows which app it is, and an agent scoped to project A will never accidentally drive project B's tab. Origin is only a fallback hint.
- **One browser, many contexts.** When agents need their own headless tabs, the daemon's **browser pool** launches a single Chromium and hands out isolated contexts (one per flow). They are cheap, and capped so a big fan-out can't exhaust the machine. Over-cap requests queue.
- **Attach-only daemon.** The daemon never starts your dev server. It connects to an app that is running (or opens a headless tab pointed at it). When nothing is running, the agent starts your project's own dev script in the background and tells you. A build process spawned by a background daemon would be invisible, unconsented, and orphaned when the daemon exits.

## Manual testing: ~5 minutes

1. Add the plugin (Vite/Next) or one `reticle.connect()` call. (See [getting-started](./getting-started.md).)
2. Start your app as you normally do.
3. Open it in a browser; the in-page panel shows Reticle is connected.
4. Click around; flag anything that looks wrong with the "Flag a bug" annotator. The agent drains those with `reticle_session {action:"review"}`.

## Agent testing: ~2 minutes

With the app running and instrumented, an agent drives a flow end to end:

```text
reticle_lease {action:"acquire"} { url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard" }
  → { sessionId: "lease-…", ready: true, leased: 1, queued: 0 }
reticle_act    { sessionId, ... }      # drive the flow
reticle_assert { sessionId, ... }      # verify intent
reticle_lease {action:"release"} { sessionId }    # free the slot
```

`reticle_lease {action:"acquire"}` opens a fresh isolated headless context against your **already-running** app, stamps the lease identity into the URL so the app's own SDK registers under a sessionId you can target, and waits until that tab has connected (`ready: true`) before returning, so the sessionId is usable immediately. Release when the flow finishes.

## 10 agents, 10 flows, one dashboard

This is the design target, and it needs no special setup:

- Each agent calls `reticle_lease {action:"acquire"}` for the same dashboard URL → its own isolated context (own cookies/storage) in the **one** shared Chromium.
- The pool caps simultaneous contexts (`RETICLE_MAX_CONTEXTS`, default scales with CPU under a ceiling); extra acquires queue and proceed as slots free.
- Flows can't bleed into each other: contexts are isolated and every session is scoped by `projectId`.
- A single crashed page is reclaimed on its own, and if an agent crashes or hangs its lease stops being touched and the **lease reaper** reclaims the context after a TTL, freeing the slot. One dead agent never starves the others.

`reticle_sessions` lists everything with `projectId` (group by app) and `leased` (pool context vs a human tab), so an orchestrator can see the whole fleet at a glance.

## Knobs

| Env | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RETICLE_MAX_CONTEXTS` | `min(8, cpus-1)` | Max simultaneous leased headless contexts. |
| `RETICLE_PORT` | from `.reticle.json`, else `4400` | Daemon port (rarely needed; discovery handles it). |

## Why not just open many browsers?

Ten Chromiums is hundreds of MB each and will thrash a laptop. Ten contexts in one browser is a few MB apiece and fully isolated: same correctness, a fraction of the cost. That's the whole point of the pool.

**Measured** (`bench/harness/multi-agent-throughput.mjs`): 16 verification flows that take **35.4s** one-at-a-time finish in **5.2s** across 8 leased contexts on a single Chromium (**6.78× faster**, ~30s saved per batch), with all 8 contexts live at peak. The speed-up scales with agent count up to the cap; the win over launching a browser per agent grows with how much per-agent browser startup you avoid.
