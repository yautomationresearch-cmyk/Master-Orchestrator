To test unpublished `@reticlehq/*` changes in a real external app, publish the workspace to a local Verdaccio with `bash scripts/local-registry.sh`, then point that app's `.npmrc` at `http://localhost:4873/` for the `@reticlehq` scope. That is the whole procedure; the rest of this page is the detail.

> **For normal use, Reticle is on public npm.** Just `npm i -D @reticlehq/react @reticlehq/vite-plugin` (see [Getting Started](getting-started.md)). You only need this guide to test **local, unpublished changes** to the Reticle packages in a real external app before they ship.

Because the `@reticlehq/*` packages depend on each other via the workspace protocol, plain `npm pack` tarballs don't resolve cleanly. The reliable way to exercise your in-progress changes in a real app is a tiny **local registry** (Verdaccio), the same path CI uses to validate a publish.

## 1. Publish @reticlehq/\* to a local registry

From the Reticle repo:

```bash
bash scripts/local-registry.sh
```

This starts a **fresh** Verdaccio on `http://localhost:4873`, creates a user/token, and publishes all `@reticlehq/*` packages there at the current workspace version:

| Package | What you install it for |
| --- | --- |
| **`@reticlehq/react`** | **install this**: the browser SDK kit you embed (re-exports the browser sensor, so one install gives both `reticle` and `install`) |
| `@reticlehq/vite-plugin` | dev-only source mapping + `connect()` injection (Vite) |
| `@reticlehq/next` | Next.js build wrapper (`withReticle`) |
| `@reticlehq/server` | the bridge + MCP server (your agent runs it, `npx @reticlehq/server mcp`) |
| `@reticlehq/babel-plugin` | React 19 source stamping (Babel) |
| `@reticlehq/test` | write declarative, signal-bound specs (`reticleTest`) |
| `@reticlehq/eslint-plugin` | the `require-signal-on-mutation` lint rule |
| `@reticlehq/core` | shared wire contract (pulled in automatically) |

For a browser app, install `@reticlehq/react` plus the build plugin for your framework (`@reticlehq/vite-plugin` or `@reticlehq/next`); `@reticlehq/server` is what your agent runs. (Verified: an external `npm i @reticlehq/react` resolves its graph, including `@reticlehq/core`, and imports correctly.) Leave the registry running.

> Note: pre-2.0 docs used a single `@reticlehq/core` umbrella package that re-exported everything; it's been split into the audience-scoped packages above.

## 2. Point your app at the local registry

In your app's project root, add an `.npmrc`. The scope is **`@reticlehq`**, not `@reticle`: a scope typo here does not error, it silently resolves the PUBLISHED packages from npm, so you measure shipped code and think you tested your branch. Everything outside that scope still comes from npm:

```ini
@reticlehq:registry=http://localhost:4873/
```

## 3. Install + wire it up

Install the SDK kit plus the Vite build plugin (source mapping + `connect()` injection):

```bash
npm i -D @reticlehq/react @reticlehq/vite-plugin
# Next.js instead of Vite? npm i -D @reticlehq/react @reticlehq/next
# optional: npm i -D @reticlehq/eslint-plugin   # require-signal-on-mutation lint rule
```

Then follow [Getting Started](getting-started.md): embed `reticle.connect()` (dev only) from `@reticlehq/react`, add the MCP server to your agent, and (React) `install()` the adapter from `@reticlehq/react`. For the fastest agent loop, also do [Step 6: make your app agent-legible](getting-started.md) (testids, `reticle.signal`, `registerStore`, `registerCapabilities`) and the [integration patterns](integration-patterns.md) (`createReticleEmitter` for zero prod-bundle cost).

> **Upgrading.** `scripts/local-registry.sh` resets Verdaccio and republishes at whatever version the workspace is on right now, so your app will not pick up a rebuild on its own. Pull it explicitly with `@latest`:
>
> ```bash
> npm i -D @reticlehq/react@latest @reticlehq/vite-plugin@latest @reticlehq/eslint-plugin@latest
> ```

**Run the MCP server** from the local registry too; `npx @reticlehq/server` _is_ the server:

```jsonc
// .mcp.json: point npx at the local registry so it fetches @reticlehq/server from Verdaccio
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reticle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--registry", "http://localhost:4873/", "@reticlehq/server", "mcp"],
    },
  },
}
```

## Next.js specifics (verified on Next 15 / React 19)

`next.config.mjs`:

```js
import reticleNext from '@reticlehq/next';
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};
export default reticleNext.withReticle(nextConfig); // dev-only; keeps SWC; adds file:line mapping
```

Mount the SDK from a dev-only client component (see the Next.js section in [Getting Started](getting-started.md)).

## Real input for hover/drag (optional)

Synthetic events can't trigger native `onMouseEnter`/pointer state (hover menus, tooltips, pointer drag). Enable **real input** so the server drives genuine pointer input and `reticle_act` reports `inputMode:"real"`:

- **Easiest (`reticle drive`):** Reticle launches its own scriptable, headless-capable browser at your app URL (no flags to juggle):

  ```bash
  npx --registry http://localhost:4873/ @reticlehq/server drive http://localhost:4310   # add --headed to watch
  ```

- **Or attach to your own browser:** launch it with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, then point the MCP server at it via `env`:

  ```jsonc
  // .mcp.json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "reticle": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["--registry", "http://localhost:4873/", "@reticlehq/server", "mcp"],
        "env": { "RETICLE_CDP_URL": "http://localhost:9222" },
      },
    },
  }
  ```

With neither set, Reticle stays synthetic (zero extra deps) and says so via `inputMode`. See [usage §18](usage.md#18-real-input-mode-native-hover--drag).

## Write replayable specs + git-checked flows

- **Specs:** with `@reticlehq/test`, turn checks into `reticleTest("…", async t => { await t.act(...); await t.expectSignal(...) })`. They are signal/testid-bound, `reticle_clock` for determinism, `t.expectInputModeReal()` to skip-with-reason when real input isn't active. Run them headless via `reticle drive` (the same path CI uses).
- **Flows:** record a flow once and Reticle writes it to a git-checked `.reticle/flows/<name>.json` (anchored on testid/signal); `reticle_flow_replay` re-resolves anchors at run time and reports **legible drift** with a nearest-match; `reticle_flow_heal` proposes/applies the rebind. A fresh agent reads `.reticle/contract.json` to learn your testable surface without grepping source.

## When you're ready for real npm

The same packages publish to public npm unchanged: `pnpm -r publish --access public` after `npm login`. The Verdaccio run above is a faithful rehearsal of that.

## Cleanup

```bash
pkill -f verdaccio     # stop the local registry
# remove the line from your app's .npmrc when you switch to published packages
```
