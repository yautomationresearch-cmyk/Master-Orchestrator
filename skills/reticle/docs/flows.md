title: Flows and the recorder

A **flow** is a recorded interactive run that Reticle stores as JSON under `.reticle/flows/` and replays forever with no AI model in the loop. Steps are anchored on **meaning** (a testid, a signal, or an auto-derived component + source location), never on a `eXX` ref or a coordinate, so they survive refactors; when an anchor does drift, `reticle_flow_replay` names what changed and `reticle_flow_heal` can rebind it.

Reticle turns an interactive run into a **git-checked, replayable program** stored under `.reticle/`. Flows are anchored on **meaning** (testid + signal), not volatile element refs or coordinates, so they survive refactors, and when an anchor does drift, Reticle tells you _why_ and can repair it. This is what makes Reticle "the project's living test suite a human seeds and an agent maintains."

> All of this is on-disk and human-readable, so flows are reviewed in PRs and diffed like code.

## The `.reticle/` directory

When you record or save a contract, Reticle writes a git-checked workspace next to your app:

```
.reticle/
  contract.json            # the app's testable surface (testids, signals, stores)
  flows/
    create-drop.json       # a recorded, anchored, replayable flow
  baselines/               # snapshot baselines (co-located)
```

The server resolves `.reticle/` from the working directory it runs in (your project root). A fresh agent can read `.reticle/contract.json` to learn the testable surface **without grepping your source**.

## The contract: advertise the testable surface

In your app, declare what's testable (see [Step 6 in Getting Started](getting-started.md)):

```ts
import { registerCapabilities } from '@reticlehq/react';
registerCapabilities({
  testids: ['add-task', 'checkout'],
  signals: ['order:saved'],
  stores: ['cart'],
});
```

Then persist it to disk so it's committed and any agent can read it:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `reticle_capabilities()` | the live testable surface `{ testids, signals, stores, flows }` |
| `reticle_contract_save()` | write the live capabilities to `.reticle/contract.json` (versioned, diffable) |

## Create a flow

**(a) Agent-recorded.** The agent drives, then saves:

```jsonc
reticle_record {action:"start"}({ recordingName: "create-task" })
reticle_act({ ref: "e7", action: "click" })        // … drive the golden path …
reticle_record {action:"stop"}({ recordingName: "create-task" })
reticle_flow_save({ flowName: "create-task" })          // → .reticle/flows/create-task.json
```

**(b) Human-recorded (the recorder toolbar).** With the presenter on (`present: true`), the floating panel hosts a recorder: a human clicks the golden path in the page and Reticle captures each interaction as a **semantic-anchored** step (testid, else role+name), then persists it via `reticle_flow_save_recorded`. The agent then runs and maintains it. _(First cut: structured annotations only, see below; free natural-language annotations are future work.)_

### What a flow file looks like

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "create-task",
  "steps": [
    { "tool": "reticle_act", "anchor": { "testid": "add-task" }, "action": "click" },
    {
      "tool": "reticle_act",
      "anchor": { "testid": "add-task" },
      "action": "click",
      "expect": { "signal": "task:added" },
    },
  ],
  "dynamic": [], // anchors whose CONTENT must not be asserted (LLM output)
  "success": { "signal": "saved" },
}
```

Each step binds to a **semantic anchor**, never a `eXX` ref: a `testid`/`signal` when available, else an auto-derived `component` anchor (component name + source `file:line`) for an element with no testid, so the flow stays stable with zero hand-added testids. Only when none of those resolve is a step kept `degraded: true` (a last-resort "add a testid here" marker) rather than silently dropped.

## Run a flow

```jsonc
reticle_flow {action:"list"}()                                    // → flows on disk
reticle_flow {action:"load"}({ flowName: "create-task" })   // → the flow JSON
reticle_flow_replay({ flowName: "create-task" }) // re-resolve each anchor against the LIVE DOM, run it
```

**Watch it replay on the page.** When the presenter is on (`present: true`), a replay isn't silent. Each step drives the real page, so the synthetic cursor flies to the element, the focus ring lands, and the activity log streams the journey live. You (or a teammate) literally watch the saved journey re-walk itself on your app, then see the verdict land. It's the fastest way to _see_ that a flow still works, not just read a green checkmark.

`reticle_flow_replay` returns a status:

- `ok`: every anchor resolved and every `expect` held.
- `drift`: an anchor missed (a testid was renamed, or a signal never fired). The result is **legible**, never a blind failure: `{ step, anchor, drift: { reasonKind: "testid_not_found", nearest: "send-message" } }`. (This is the "whose fault is it" principle.)
- `error`: the flow file is missing/invalid, or a resolved action failed. Runtime failures include the failed step and a top-level error envelope.

A testid-_preserving_ refactor (you moved markup but kept the testids) still replays green. A step whose element has **no testid** is anchored on its component + source location (`{ kind: "component", component, source: { file, line } }`), an auto-derived stable anchor, so a flow records cleanly with zero hand-added testids and replay re-resolves it via `reticle_query by:'component'`.

### The decision envelope: what to do next, not just pass/fail

On a `drift` or `error`, the replay result carries a `decision` an agent can act on directly:

```jsonc
decision: {
  verdict: "drift",
  whatChanged: "testid \"fault-500\" not found",
  whereInSource: "src/Diagnostics.tsx:16",   // file:line, from the component/source anchor
  suggestedFix: "rebind the anchor to \"fault-404\" (closest survivor)",
  nextAction: "rebind the anchor to \"fault-404\", or update the flow if the change was intended."
}
```

This is the feedback a human reviewer used to give, made machine-actionable, so the agent decides its next move without one.

## Verify the whole suite in one call

`reticle_verify {action:"flows"}` replays **every** saved flow (or a named subset) deterministically, with no LLM per flow, and returns one consolidated verdict. This is the regression check to run after any change:

```jsonc
reticle_verify({ action: "flows" })
// → { status: "fail", total: 4, passed: 3, failed: 1,
//     summary: "3/4 flows pass, 1 needs attention: ship-deploy",
//     failures: [{ flow: "ship-deploy", verdict: "drift",
//                  whatChanged: "...", whereInSource: "src/...:NN", nextAction: "..." }] }
```

Passing flows are counted; only failures carry detail (token-cheap). Build → `reticle_verify {action:"flows"}` → fix from each failure's `nextAction` → repeat: the autonomous regression loop.

## Self-healing: the agent maintains the flow

When a testid is renamed, the flow drifts. `reticle_flow_heal` proposes (and optionally applies) the nearest-match rebind, so flows don't rot:

```jsonc
reticle_flow_heal({ flowName: "create-task" })               // PROPOSE only, never writes
// → { status: "drift", applied: false,
//     proposals: [{ step: 0, from: "add-tassk", to: "add-task", confidence: 0.8 }] }

reticle_flow_heal({ flowName: "create-task", apply: true })  // rewrite the anchor on disk
// → { status: "healed", applied: true, proposals: [...] }
```

With `apply: false` the flow file is **never modified**; you get the proposed diff to review. With `apply: true` Reticle rewrites the drifted anchor(s) to the confident nearest match and a subsequent replay passes. A drift with **no** confident nearest match leaves the file untouched.

## Annotations (structured)

`reticle_annotate` attaches a structured annotation that compiles into the flow, so replay is a _checked_ re-run, not a blind macro:

- `assert-signal` / `assert-visible` → a step `expect` predicate (the invariant).
- `mark-dynamic` → a `flow.dynamic[]` entry; replay asserts the region's _presence_ but **not its words** (the LLM-output case: assert `caption:generated`, ignore the caption text).
- `success-state` → `flow.success` (the golden end condition). Pass `signal`/`testid`, or `statePath` (+ `store`, `equals`) to make the golden condition a **store-truth** assertion against the app's own source of truth, which no DOM read can reach (e.g. `statePath: "deployments.0.status", equals: "live"` fails the flow if a deploy only _looks_ shipped on screen). State assertions are graded as consequences, so they satisfy the business-outcome oracle.

## Flows are your test suite

`.reticle/` flows can be executed as CI specs via `@reticlehq/test`'s `flowsAsSpecs`, replayed with their `expect`/`success` predicates and skipping `dynamic` regions. See [Testing with Reticle](testing.md).
