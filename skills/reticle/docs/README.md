# Docs index

Two audiences share this directory: people using Reticle and people working on it. Every page carries a `description` in its frontmatter saying what it answers; this index is the shortcut when you want to scan all of them at once.

Everything here is published to [docs.reticle.sh](https://docs.reticle.sh) by `docs.json`, which is the Mintlify config for this directory. Five tabs. **Guides** to learn in order, grouped by what you are doing (get started, install, instrument, verify and ship, work with agents, and when it goes wrong). **Reference** to look one thing up. **Desktop** because Electron and Tauri are a different shape of problem and deserve their own front door, **Resources** to decide or to check a claim, and **Contributing** for people working on Reticle. Contributor docs sit in a tab rather than hidden, since they were reachable by URL anyway, and an unlisted page is a page nobody finds.

## For people working on Reticle

**Start:** [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) → [gates.md](gates.md).

| Page | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| [gates.md](gates.md) | **I changed some files. Which gate do I run?** |
| [gate-plan.md](gate-plan.md) | why the gates are shaped this way, and what is still unbuilt |
| [system-map.md](system-map.md) | how a tool call reaches the app, and which failures are silent |
| [telemetry-contract.md](telemetry-contract.md) | required reading before touching anything that emits |
| [telemetry-events.mdx](telemetry-events.mdx) | every event kind and its payload, and the question each one exists to answer |
| [debugging.md](debugging.md) | debugging Reticle itself: the four signals and what each answers |
| [fixtures.md](fixtures.md) | the sibling `reticle-fixtures` repo: install complexity, not regressions |
| [matrix/README.md](matrix/README.md) | submitting an MCP-client compatibility record, the best first contribution |
| [matrix/MATRIX.md](matrix/MATRIX.md) | which clients are known to work (generated; do not hand-edit) |
| [`../apps/README.md`](../apps/README.md) | what belongs in `apps/`, and what does not |
| [`../apps/e2e/harness-rules.md`](../apps/e2e/harness-rules.md) | the four rules every gate obeys, and the incident behind each |
| [`../bench/README.md`](../bench/README.md) | what in `bench/` is live and what is a kept one-off study |

`fixtures-dispatch-receiver.yml` is not a doc; it is the workflow template `reticle-fixtures` needs, kept in this repo so the two ends of the contract cannot drift apart.

**Adding a page?** Three things, all required. Give it `title` + `description` frontmatter and no `# H1`. Mintlify renders the frontmatter title as the heading, so an H1 shows up twice. Add its slug to the right tab in `docs.json`. Add a row to the right table above. A page missing from `docs.json` is one nobody can reach; a page missing from this index is one no contributor knows exists.

**Adding a second product?** Do not nest these files under a product folder pre-emptively; that renames every live URL to buy nothing. Mintlify supports `navigation.products`, where each product declares its own `directory`. When the second product exists, put its pages in `docs/<product>/`, switch `docs.json` from `tabs` to `products`, and give this product `"directory": ""` so today's URLs keep working.
