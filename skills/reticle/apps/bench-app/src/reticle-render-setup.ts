// Dev-only: install Reticle's React render meter BEFORE react-dom initializes. React reads the
// __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ at renderer-inject time, so the hook must already exist — which is
// why this is imported as the FIRST side-effect in main.tsx, ahead of the react-dom import. The meter
// counts commits and exposes them via the `__reticle_renders` store (read with reticle_state); it is
// host-safe (augments a real DevTools hook if present, everything in try/catch). Tree-shaken from prod.
