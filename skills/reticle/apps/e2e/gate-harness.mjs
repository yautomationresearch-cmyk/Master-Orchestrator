// The harness contract, as code. Read apps/e2e/harness-rules.md for why each rule exists.
//
// Every unreliable gate result in this repo's history came from the harness being a client of the
// system it measures, and inheriting its failure modes. SvelteKit was written up as an install
// failure when the daemon had died. The daemon's own idle shutdown fired during a long dependency
// install and three fixtures were scored as install failures. Two contradictory conclusions about
// MCP stability were filed a week apart, and one of them was the harness killing its own proxy.
//
// None of those were product defects. All of them were reported as product defects, because the
// harness had no way to say "the transport was gone, so I cannot attribute this".
