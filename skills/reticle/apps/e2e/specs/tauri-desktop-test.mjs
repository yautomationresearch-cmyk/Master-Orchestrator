// HONESTY-CRITICAL: prove Reticle's Tauri support against a REAL Tauri v2 binary, headless.
//
// Runs the PACKAGED build (`tauri://localhost`, frontendDist), not `tauri dev` — the dev path serves
// the frontend from an ordinary http origin, so it exercises none of what is Tauri-specific: the
// opaque origin the bridge's upgrade handler once crashed on, and the locality gate that used to
// read a desktop webview as a remote website and refuse to start.
//
// Pinned here:
//   - the webview dials the bridge from tauri://localhost
//   - an `invoke` is observed as ipc://<command> with no JavaScript-side wiring at all
//   - a command returning Err is recorded as FAILED despite the transport's HTTP 200
//   - the planted false green is reported as a contradiction
//   - `reticle_capture` photographs the webview while the window is hidden (headless)
//   - fullPage is refused on macOS/Windows rather than downgraded
//   - concurrent captures all survive, and nothing is left in the temp dir
//   - and none of those captures appears in the app's own network evidence

  /**
   * The webview must still be there a few seconds later.
   *
   * Everything above runs within a couple of seconds of connect, so this spec only ever proved that
   * Tauri works IMMEDIATELY after connect — and an agent doing real work is past that in one tool
   * call. Nothing here had ever checked that the session survives an ordinary pause.
   *
   * It does: this passes. The check exists because the absence of it is unfalsifiable, not because a
   * failure was found.
   *
   * ONE ATTEMPT WAS NOT ENOUGH, and the note that used to sit here — "did not reproduce once the
   * machine was quiet, and is not evidence of anything" — turned out to be the whole story rather
   * than an aside. Measured: three consecutive failures on a loaded machine, then four consecutive
   * passes on a quiet one across four different commits INCLUDING the same HEAD that had just
   * failed. The assertion was flipping on machine load, which makes it useless as a gate: it blocks
   * a good release at random, and teaches everyone to re-run until green.
   *
   * The claim being made is "the session is still ALIVE after a pause", and that is kept exactly.
   * What changes is the waiting: a hidden WKWebView is throttled by the platform, so a single 8s
   * command can time out on a webview that is merely slow to be scheduled rather than dead. It now
   * retries until the session answers or the window closes — a dead session still fails, it just
   * takes the full window to say so.
