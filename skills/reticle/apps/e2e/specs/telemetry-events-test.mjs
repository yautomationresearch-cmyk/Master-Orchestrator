/**
 * Every telemetry / feedback / error / crash event, fired for real and checked on the wire.
 *
 * This spec exists because of a bug the unit tests could not have caught. `daemon_stopped` — the one
 * event carrying a whole session — was emitted fire-and-forget microseconds before `process.exit(0)`,
 * so the POST was killed every single time and the event NEVER arrived. Nothing threw. No assertion
 * failed. The only way to see it was to stand up a real HTTP endpoint and notice nothing landed.
 *
 * So this drives the REAL built modules from `dist` against a real capture server: real network, real
 * process semantics, real redaction. It needs no browser and none of the battery's three servers,
 * which also makes it the cheapest and most reliable spec in the suite.
 *
 * Half the checks are leak checks. Telemetry is the one subsystem where a mistake is silent, shipped,
 * and about somebody else's data — so every payload that could carry a secret, a password, a customer
 * email, or a home directory is asserted NOT to.
