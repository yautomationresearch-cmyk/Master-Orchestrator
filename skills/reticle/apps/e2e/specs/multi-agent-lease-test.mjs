// Committed regression guard for the multi-agent / browser-pool path: many agents lease isolated
// headless contexts from ONE shared browser against the bench-app dashboard (:4310), capped and queued, each
// usable on return. Locks in what was validated by hand: resource is bounded, leases correlate to
// real sessions, and conflicting concurrent flows don't cross-talk. Boots its own bridge on :4400.
