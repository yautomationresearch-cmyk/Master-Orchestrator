// Call EVERY shipped tool the way an agent calls it — over MCP stdio, against a running app.
//
// This spec exists because four defects shipped past every other gate, and all four were invisible
// to the way the rest of this repo tests. Unit tests call handlers directly. The other e2e specs
// call `TOOLS.find(...).handler(...)` directly too. Both skip the MCP layer entirely — and the MCP
// layer is where tool schemas are ENFORCED, where errors are classified, and where the provider an
// agent actually gets is assembled. Testing under it cannot see any of that.
//
// What it caught, running once by hand:
//   1. `reticle_verify_change` returned a payload its own outputSchema rejected, so the MCP layer
//      answered -32602 for the two COMMONEST paths ("no files given", "nothing covers this").
//   2. `reticle_viewport` / `reticle_network_mock` refused with `no-cdp-provider` under
//      `reticle drive` — the provider that flag creates lacked both methods — while recommending
//      `reticle drive` as the fix, which is what the caller had already done.
//   3. A stale ref after a re-render was classified "not one Reticle recognizes… may be a defect in
//      Reticle", inviting a bug report for the most ordinary thing that follows a click.
//   4. Reticle's own argument-validation errors were classified the same way.
//
// So it does NOT assert "everything returns ok" — several tools correctly refuse. It asserts the
// four properties whose absence produced those bugs:
//   - every advertised tool is CALLABLE (no protocol error, no schema violation);
//   - a refusal is RECOGNIZED (carries a reason/code or a recovery), never an unknown defect;
//   - no response tells the agent its own bad call may be a Reticle bug;
//   - the tools that require a driven browser actually work when one is driven.
