  // the one file users are told to open.
  'daemon-heartbeat-test',

  // link in NAMED ways — reset, blackhole, truncate, latency — instead of SIGKILLing a process. It

 * and any spec that assumes it owns the session fails with "multiple sessions connected".
 *
 * That cost most of an afternoon: three different specs failed across three runs, each of them
 * correct, all of them poisoned by two Chrome tabs on :4310 and :7699. Every hypothesis about the
 * code was wrong, because the fault was not in the code.
 *
 * It has to BAIT them rather than just look: before the battery starts nothing is listening, so
 * there is nothing for a stray tab to be connected TO. The tabs reconnect to whatever appears on
 * 4400, so this stands a daemon up for a few seconds and sees who turns up. The first version of
 * this check polled an empty port, found nothing, and would have reported all-clear every time.
 *
 * Moving the battery to a private port is the real fix and is a bigger job: bench-app, next-smoke
 * and atlas each hardcode how they dial, and half of them silently stopped connecting when the port
 * moved. Until that is done, this names the cause in one line at the top of the run instead of
 * letting a different innocent spec fail each time.
