// Tier 1: install Reticle into apps that have never seen it, and check a session actually appears.
//
// Every gate in this repo is blind to the install. `apps/bench-app`, `apps/next-smoke` and the rest
// are ALREADY instrumented, so re-running `init` over one reports `·` (already wired) for every step
// and proves nothing — which is exactly how a Next.js install shipped connecting 0% of the time
// through three independent defects, none of which any check short of opening a browser could see.
//
// The pristine surface is SCAFFOLDED rather than vendored. `npm create vite` and `create-next-app`
// produce apps that have never seen Reticle, in seconds, with nothing to store or maintain. That
// catches install REGRESSIONS. It does not catch install COMPLEXITY — a 70-dependency app with ten
// Vite plugins is a different question, and it belongs in the reticle-fixtures gate (Tier 2), which
// is slower and cannot block a PR. Conflating the two gives a gate too slow to block and too shallow
// to trust.
//
// Four scaffolds, because `init` has four genuinely different paths into an app. The third matters
// most for framework reasons: a Pages Router app has no `app/` root layout to patch, so connect has
// to mount through `pages/_app` — and that is the path that once did nothing at all, silently.
//
// The fourth is a different axis entirely: the first three are all the same SHAPE — a single-app root
// with `init` run inside it — and that sameness is what made this gate blind to four init defects one
// user hit in eight minutes. `monorepo-subdir` is the shape those live in.
//
//   pnpm gate:install                 # all scaffolds

// ── Never phone home from the gate ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Set BEFORE anything spawns, and on this process rather than per-call, so every child inherits it —
// the `reticle init` runs, the dev servers, and the daemon whichever of them starts it. Per-spawn
// env is how the next site added here quietly leaks.
//
// This is the ONE harness the source-checkout guard does not cover. That guard walks up from `cwd`
// looking for the monorepo's package.json, and this gate deliberately scaffolds PRISTINE apps into
// the OS temp directory and installs Reticle into them from a local Verdaccio — which is the entire
// point of it, and which means those daemons are, correctly, not in a source checkout.
//
// So it emitted real events. Measured in one day of production data: 308 CI rows from 19 distinct
// anonymous ids — every runner a brand-new "user" — carrying 144 of the 169 `init_completed` events
// and 19 `reticle_installed`. The gate was the majority of our own install funnel, and on a release
// branch it reports that branch's version, so unreleased versions appear in production dashboards.
//
// `RETICLE_TELEMETRY=0` and not `RETICLE_TELEMETRY_FILE`: the gate asserts on `init`'s printed plan,
// never on emitted events, so there is nothing here worth recording.

// human at a machine — which is how our own gate traffic became indistinguishable from a user's in
// the one dataset that decides what gets built. Set here rather than relied on from the environment,
// so the claim is true regardless of who invoked this.
