//   node apps/e2e/soak.mjs                 # against a bench-app already on :4310
//   node apps/e2e/soak.mjs --rounds 40     # longer soak

//   node apps/e2e/soak.mjs --self-check    # prove the gate can go RED without touching a daemon
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// "The MCP connection breaks a lot" is the oldest open complaint about this product, and every gate
// in this repo answers it with a boolean. A boolean cannot express "a lot", and a number nobody
// RECORDS cannot regress — so a link that quietly degrades from 1 drop in 500 calls to 1 in 20 would
// pass every check here today, right up until a user notices. This records the rate.
//
// It also answers the sharper question: WHICH tool is breaking. `mcp-stress-test` proves the server
// survives; `tool-surface-sweep` proves each tool is callable once. Neither says that
// `reticle_snapshot` fails one time in thirty, because one call cannot have a failure rate.
//
// WHAT IS GATED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT
//
//   HARD GATE   answer rate. Every call must be ANSWERED — the product's own claim, and the thing
//               `transport-faults-test` proves under injected faults. Deterministic: a call is
//               answered or it is not.
//   HARD GATE   per-tool failure rate, against the recorded baseline. Also deterministic.
//   RECORDED    latency (p50/p95/max, per tool). NOT gated on an absolute duration, ever.
//
// That last line is a deliberate deviation from the phrase "latency budget" in the plan, and the
// reason is written down in CLAUDE.md: timing assertions are a bug. A p95 budget in wall-clock
// milliseconds is a statement about the machine, so it goes red only under parallel CI load — which
// teaches everyone to re-run it, and a gate people re-run is a gate that has stopped working. The
// number is still worth having, so it is recorded, printed, and diffed against the baseline as a
// LOUD WARN. A human reads a 4x p95 jump; a robot must not fail the build for it.
