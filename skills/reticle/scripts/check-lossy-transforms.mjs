// Lossy-transform guard for the Reticle read path.
//
// THE INVARIANT
//
//   Any transform that can drop, truncate, or shape-coerce data on a path an agent reads must
//   report that it did, in a machine-readable way the consumer can detect.
//
// The consumer is an agent deciding whether a green verdict is trustworthy. A partial answer it
// cannot distinguish from a complete one is a false green — the failure this whole project exists to
// prevent. A note in a log, or a value quietly shortened with nothing to say so, is not a report.
//
// WHY A GUARD AND NOT DISCIPLINE
//
// The rule was broken three separate times, each found by hand and fixed in isolation: the ring
// buffer dropped events so an agent got a confident false negative; the offline queue dropped events
// during a bridge blip while the ledger still read clean; capDepth coerced a Map to `{}` with no
// marker, immediately upstream of the one function that gets this right. Three instances of one
// shape is a missing invariant, not three bugs.
//
// WHAT THIS CATCHES, AND WHAT IT HONESTLY DOES NOT
//
// Catches: a NEW export appearing in a read-path module without anybody classifying it, and a
// classified-lossy export with no conformance test naming it. That is the moment someone who has
// never heard of this rule is made to answer the question, which is the entire value.
//
// Does NOT catch: a newly-lossy BRANCH added inside a function already listed here. Nothing textual
// can. Stated so nobody mistakes a green guard for a proof.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/check-lossy-transforms.mjs            # check the real tree; exit 1 on drift
//   node scripts/check-lossy-transforms.mjs --self-test # prove the guard fails on a synthetic gap
//
// Wired into `pnpm lint`, so drift fails the build. See CONTRIBUTING.md ("Lossy transforms declare
// their loss") and packages/*/src/**/lossy-conformance.test.ts for the behavioural half.
