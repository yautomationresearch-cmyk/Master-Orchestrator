//   node bench/harness/bench-all.mjs            # deterministic REPLAY pass (fast, pure Reticle) — default
//   node bench/harness/bench-all.mjs --full      # + OBSERVATION-COST pass (scripted; slow, boots tool MCPs)
//   node bench/harness/bench-all.mjs --no-boot    # don't start fixtures (use ones you already have up)
//
// The three measurement passes (see bench/SCORECARD.md legend):
//   - OBSERVATION-COST ("Layer A"): drive each tool's MCP directly, measure the tokens it injects per look.
//   - AGENT-LOOP       ("Layer B"): a real LLM drives the tool — costs money + needs a key, NEVER run here.
//   - REPLAY           ("Layer C"): re-run a saved flow with no model — Reticle's deterministic floor.
//
// By default this boots the fixtures the passes drive (the demo app + the api backend), health-checks
// them, runs the EXISTING harness scripts, and tears the fixtures down on exit. Each script writes its
// own bench/raw/*.json; gate.mjs reads those. (Raw JSON keys keep the A/B/C codes for data continuity.)
