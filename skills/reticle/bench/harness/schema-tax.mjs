// The per-request MCP tool-schema tax: tokens an agent pays on EVERY request just to have the tools
// available, before it does any work.
//
// This is the cost the field is currently organised around. Microsoft's own playwright-mcp README now
// steers coding agents to the CLI over MCP explicitly because "CLI invocations are more token-efficient:
// they avoid loading large tool schemas"; a filed issue measures the default Playwright MCP tool list at
// 14.4k tokens = 7.2% of a Claude Code context window
// (https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/1290), and chrome-devtools-mcp is reported near
// 17k. Users respond by turning the servers off — "there is absolutely no reason I'd keep it enabled".
//
// The previous artifact for this metric was measured once, under the project's OLD name, against the
// then-57-tool FULL surface, and was never re-run. It has been quoted since as though it described the
// shipping default. It did not: the default is `hybrid`. Every number below is measured live, in one
// run, through the same client and the same counter, so the comparison is arithmetic rather than
// archaeology.
//
//   node bench/harness/schema-tax.mjs            # all servers
//   node bench/harness/schema-tax.mjs reticle    # ours only (no network install)

/** Ours, one entry per advertised profile — the whole point is that the DEFAULT is what gets paid. */

// `standard` were retired (see packages/server/src/tools/tool-surface.ts). Measured per surface here.
