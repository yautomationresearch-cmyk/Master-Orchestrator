# Reticle benchmark scorecard — the honest one-page standing

> One synthesis of everything measured, across all layers. Wins, ties, and caveats stated plainly — no inflation. Every number is produced by a committed harness; detail + raw data linked per row. Tokens are the `o200k` proxy unless a row says "authoritative usage" (full agent loop).

## ⚠ Freshness — check this before quoting any number below

Numbers in this file are left **exactly as they were measured**, which is the right convention for a record and the wrong one for a quote. Two things have moved since.

**1. The replay numbers were re-measured on 2026-08-11 and they went UP.**

| Metric | In the tables below (2026-06/07) | Re-measured 2026-08-11 | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Replay, per run | ~175 tok (128–184×) | **239 tok (127×)** | verdict payload grew |
| Suite verify, K=2 | 47 tok (1287×) | **68 tok (890×)** | each flow now carries a success oracle, and the verdict reports per-flow |
| Suite verify, K=4 | 47 tok (2574×) | **68 tok (1779×)** | same; still **constant in K**, which is the actual claim |

The shape of the claim survives — suite read-cost is flat in K, so the ratio still compounds with suite size — but **1779× is the current 4-flow figure, not 2574×**. `47` was never reproducible from the committed raw either: `raw/suite-rre.json` held `29` before this re-measurement, so three different numbers were in circulation for one metric. Quote the re-measured column.

**2. Every Playwright / DevTools column is historical.** The cross-tool passes last ran **2026-06-22**, against `@playwright/mcp@0.0.76` and `chrome-devtools-mcp@1.3.0`. Both have shipped since (0.0.79 and **1.7.0**), and Reticle has moved 0.8.0 → 2.5.0. Nobody should quote a competitive delta from this file without re-running `pnpm bench:full` first. See [`README.md`](README.md#versions-the-competitive-numbers-were-measured-against--read-before-quoting).

Rows below are unedited on purpose — a measurement record that gets quietly rewritten stops being a record. This banner is the correction.

## Read this first — what the terms mean

Plain-language legend, so the numbers below make sense even if you've never written a test:

| Term | In plain English |
| --- | --- |
| **Regression** | A bug that creeps back in — something that used to work and now doesn't. |
| **Catch / detection** | Did the tool actually NOTICE the bug? (vs. silently passing.) |
| **False positive** | Crying wolf — flagging a bug when nothing is wrong. We want zero. |
| **Token** | The unit of how much an AI model reads/writes. Fewer tokens = cheaper + faster + less context clutter. |
| **Observation cost** | How many tokens a tool spends to _look_ at the app once. |
| **Detection accuracy** | Of all the bugs (and the no-bug control), what fraction did the tool judge correctly. |
| **Catch rate (was "RCR")** | Of the real bugs, what fraction the tool caught. A correctness floor — being cheap doesn't count until you catch them all. |
| **Verification Efficiency (was "VE")** | Bugs caught per 1,000 tokens spent — _coverage and cost together_. Our headline metric. |
| **Re-run efficiency (was "RRE")** | Tokens to re-check a known flow _every time_ (every commit/CI run). Reticle replays with NO model, so this compounds. |
| **Large-DOM loop test** | The token cost of one verify loop on a big page — where the savings vs. screenshots actually show. |
| **The three measurement passes** | **observation-cost pass** (just the look, no model — "Layer A"); **full-agent-loop pass** (a real model drives it, authoritative token counts — "Layer B"); **replay pass** (re-run a saved flow with no model — "Layer C"). |

> The short codes (RCR/VE/RRE, Layer A/B/C) are kept in the raw data files for continuity, but everywhere a human reads, we now use the plain names above. A full teach-from-scratch explainer lives in `docs/benchmarks.md`.

## The metric we chase

**Regression-Run Efficiency (RRE): tokens an agent/CI reads to re-verify a known flow, per run.** A test suite's real job is the SAME verification over and over; that is the axis where Reticle's deterministic replay compounds against tools that must re-drive with an LLM every run. (`METRIC.md`)

## Where Reticle stands (measured)

| Dimension | Reticle | Playwright MCP | DevTools MCP | Honest verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Detection — Observation-cost** (10 scripted regressions, catch-rate gate) | **RCR 1.0, VE 12.27** (avg 815 tok) | RCR 0.9, VE 6.97 | RCR 0.8, VE 10.55 | Reticle catches all (det 1.0); competitors miss 1–2 each. VE **clears the best external tool** — Reticle is the only tool at full detection AND the lowest VE-qualifying cost. (`METRIC.md`) |
| **Detection — Agent-loop** (real gpt-4o agent loop, authoritative usage) | **5/5 @ ~55k tok** | 4/5 @ ~30k | 3/5 @ ~32k | Reticle most accurate; ~1.7× tokens. (`agent-loop-and-replay.md`) |
| **Regression-run cost — Replay** (replay a known flow) | **~175 tok, deterministic** | ~30,249 (LLM re-drive) | ~32,296 | **128–184× cheaper per run**, compounding. (`agent-loop-and-replay.md` Layer C) |
| **Suite-scale RRE — Replay** (re-verify a K-flow suite, per run) | **47 tok at K=2 AND K=4 — constant in K** (`reticle_flow_verify`) | K × ~30,249 | K × ~32,296 | **The chased metric, compounding: 1287× at 2 flows → 2574× at 4 → grows with suite size.** One consolidated verdict (passing counted, only failures detailed) ⇒ agent read-cost is ~flat in K; competitors re-drive every flow. (`suite-rre`) |
| **Regression detection — Replay** | selector 3/3, consequence 2/2 (green-but-wrong) | no replay | no replay | Reticle-only: deterministic replay catches + names the fix. |
| **State-oracle regression — Replay** (dead Ship handler; store never changes) | **1/1 CAUGHT @ ~472 tok (64×)** | no replay | no replay | Reticle-only: a `state` success-oracle (`deployments.0.status==live`) fails when the store didn't change, with no testid drift — the button is present and clicks fine. (`replay-detect-state`) |
| **State blast-radius — Replay** (action mutates UNRELATED store state; nothing visible changes) | **1/1 CAUGHT @ ~459 tok (66×)** | impossible | impossible | **Reticle-only — the deepest moat.** A `state { hold:true }` INVARIANT fails when Compose corrupts an unrelated path (`deployments.0.status`) as a side-effect. The corrupted view isn't even rendered, so no DOM/visual tool can see it; the blast radius lives in program state. Distinct from the state-oracle (intended change ABSENT) — this is an unintended change PRESENT. (`state-blast-radius-bench`) |
| **Network-cardinality regression — Replay** (must-call-N _and_ must-never-call; UI identical) | **2/2 CAUGHT @ ~484/495 tok (61–62×)** | observes requests (no replay) | observes requests (no replay) | A `net { count }` success-oracle fails when an action fires a request the WRONG number of times: `count:1` catches a **double-submit** (fires twice), `count:0` catches a **forbidden call** (a must-never-fire endpoint — reverted migration / privacy beacon / N+1). A presence check passes both; no testid drift. Honest: raw counting is parity (Playwright `route`, DevTools network); the win is the count as a DECLARED, deterministic replay consequence, read post-settle. (`network-cardinality-bench`, `forbidden-call-bench`) |
| **Console-error regression — Replay** (action logs a console.error, UI still renders) | **1/1 CAUGHT @ ~435 tok (70×)** | reads console (no replay) | reads console (no replay) | A `console { absent:true }` success-oracle fails when the action logs an error a structural/visual check sails past. No testid drift. Honest: raw console capture is parity (Playwright `page.on('console')`, DevTools); the win is "clean console" as a DECLARED, deterministic replay consequence, read post-settle so it can't pass before the error fires. (`console-clean-bench`) |
| **Visual / computed-style / theme** (6 bugs) | 6/6 | 6/6 | 6/6 | **Parity.** Any evaluate reads computed style; Reticle's edge is ergonomic (native vs +117–259 JS tok). (`UI-BUG-BENCH.md`) |
| **State / UI desync** (UI lies about the store — class of 2) | **2/2 CAUGHT** (count + status, ~47–67 tok) | 0/2 | 0/2 | **Reticle-only capability** — competitors read the displayed value but have no store truth to contradict it. (`UI-BUG-BENCH.md`) |
| **Time-travel** (verify a time-gated flow: deploy building→live after 2.6s) | **~202 ms, deterministic** (freeze+advance clock) | real-wait ≥2600 ms | real-wait ≥2600 ms | Reticle controls the app's `setTimeout`/`Date`, so it verifies the transition instantly and EXACTLY. Competitors are capable but must sleep through real time and guess the duration (under-wait → flaky). 15× here; **scales with timer length** — a 30 s/5 min timeout is 100–1000×. (`clock-timetravel`) |
| **Source localization** (which component renders this element + where) | **stack 4/4, source 4/4** (e.g. `["Sidebar","App"]` @ `Sidebar.tsx:34`) | CSS selector only | CSS selector only | The React render **stack** is fiber-derived → Reticle-only; an agent gets the component + file to edit in one call. Honest: raw `file:line` is parity where the babel plugin stamped `data-reticle-source`; the component identity/stack is not. (`source-localize`) |
| **Wasted-render storm** (React thrashing, DOM visually identical) | **DETECTED — 108 vs 36 commits/s, ~50 tok** (`__reticle_renders`) | no signal | no signal | **Reticle-only.** Reticle counts React commits via the devtools hook; a storm that re-renders with identical output produces no DOM mutation, so a screenshot/DOM tool sees an idle page. (`render-storm-bench`) |
| **Flake rate / determinism — Replay** (same flow, replayed 8×) | **0% flake — 1 status, 1 verdict across 8 runs** (~190 tok, spread 6) | LLM re-drive (sampled) | LLM re-drive (sampled) | **Reticle-only structural win.** No model in the regression loop + clock control ⇒ a CI gate diffs the verdict exactly, run after run. Competitors re-drive every run with an LLM (temperature/tool-order/token counts vary) — the verdict is sampled, not deterministic. Flakiness is the #1 regression-suite tax; Reticle pays 0 by construction. (`replay-determinism`) |
| **Multi-agent throughput** (16 flows, one Chromium, 8 leased contexts) | **5.2s pooled vs 35.4s serial — 6.78× faster** | one browser per agent | one browser per agent | **Reticle-only model** — N agents lease **isolated** contexts (separate cookies/storage/DOM) from ONE browser; the alternatives launch a browser per agent (RAM + startup per agent). ~30s saved per batch, 8-way peak concurrency, FIFO queue over cap, auto-reclaim of hung leases. (`multi-agent-throughput`) |

## Real-app validation (the Reticle dashboard, not the demo)

The table above is the controlled lab. We also ran Reticle against a **real production app** — the Reticle dashboard (React 19, auth, live data, ~15 routes) — with the SDK embedded, driven by all three tools.

| Observe the authenticated dashboard once | Snapshot | Network | **Total** | Assert success? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Reticle** | 678 | 345 | **1,023** | ✅ app `auth:logged-in` signal — 46 tok, un-fakeable |
| Chrome DevTools MCP | 1,105 | 252 | 1,357 | ❌ DOM/network only |
| Playwright MCP | 1,522 | 671 | 2,193 | ❌ DOM/network only |

- **2.1× leaner than Playwright MCP** on a real complex app; cheapest overall.
- **Tier-1, demonstrated live:** only Reticle read program state (`authenticated`, `userId`, `activeProjectId`) and asserted login from the app's own signal — the others cannot.
- **A real bug, caught on the first pass (uninstrumented):** `GET /projects` and `/recovery/incidents` returning `500 — column "deleted_at" does not exist` (a missing migration). The page rendered fine; a screenshot would call it "done." Reproduced honestly, then fixed.

Full walkthrough + the from-scratch explainer: [`docs/benchmarks.md`](../docs/benchmarks.md) Part 5.

## The one honest sentence

**Reticle ties on anything a user can see in the DOM (with a real, growing cost/ergonomic advantage), and wins outright where the bug requires seeing the program itself — its state, and the same flow run again deterministically.** Not "Reticle sees pixels better"; "Reticle sees the program, and over repeated runs it is two orders of magnitude cheaper."

- **Decisive wins:** (1) **regression-run cost** — 128–184× per run, compounding to 2574× at suite scale; (2) **0% flake** — a deterministic, model-free verdict where competitors re-drive with a sampled LLM every run; and (3) a **declared-consequence family** that catches bugs whose truth never reaches the DOM. A flow's `success` end-condition compiles to a real, post-settle predicate over `signal | state | net{count} | console | state{hold}` — so one cheap replay catches a UI-vs-store **desync**, a dead-handler **state oracle**, a **double-submit** (net cardinality), a silent **console error**, and an action's unintended **blast-radius** mutation. None of these can be faked by a healed-to-wrong-element locator, and the last three are invisible to any out-of-page tool. These fuse with RRE: the catch runs **deterministically in the cheap replay loop**, not as a one-off manual read-and-compare.
- **Ties (honest):** every visually-observable bug — computed style, geometry, occlusion, color, theme — is reachable by any tool with a JS-`evaluate`. Reticle is more ergonomic (one native call, no JS authoring), not more capable.
- **Within-field 100× is real only on RRE** (repeated regression runs), not on single-shot detection (you can't catch 100× more than ~10 bugs). Stated so it can't be misread. (`METRIC.md`)

## What Reticle does, and at what scale

Reticle gives a coding agent four verbs against a running app it owns — **look, act, observe, assert** — plus a **replay** loop that turns any recorded flow into a deterministic regression test. The scale that matters is not "one check" but "the same check, every edit, forever":

| Capability | What it is | Measured scale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Look / observe** | a11y snapshot, query, inspect (+computed style/theme), network, console, React render meter | **~100–945 tok** per observation vs ~7,300 for a full-tree snapshot (architectural, not pixels) |
| **Verify loop on a large DOM** | query → act_and_wait → assert against the success signal, on a non-virtualized N-row grid (`apps/large-dom-bench`) | **~279 tok loop vs a 3,636-tok full snapshot — 13× wedge, flat from 800 to 5,000 rows**; vs a screenshot agent (1,365 image-tok/look × N, blind to the signal) the gap is far larger (`measure-large-dom.mjs`) |
| **Assert (consequence)** | a flow's success compiles to a real predicate: `signal \| state \| net{count} \| console \| state{hold}` | one assertion, **post-settle**, un-fakeable by a healed-to-wrong-element locator |
| **Replay (the moat)** | re-run a recorded flow with **no LLM**, re-resolve anchors, assert the consequence | **~175 tok/run, 128–184× cheaper** than an LLM re-drive; **0% flake** over 8 identical runs |
| **Suite replay** | `reticle_flow_verify` — one consolidated verdict over K flows | **~47 tok at K=2 and K=4 (constant in K)** → **1287× at 2 flows, 2574× at 4**, grows with K |
| **Program-state truth** | read the store/React state the DOM never showed (desync, dead-handler oracle, blast-radius) | **5/5 Reticle-only catches**; competitors score **0** (no store access) at **~47–472 tok** |
| **Time control** | freeze/advance the app clock to verify a time-gated flow | **~202 ms** vs a real ≥2,600 ms wait; **scales with the timer** (a 5-min timeout → ~1000×) |
| **Source localization** | fiber → component → `file:line` so the agent edits the right file | **stack 4/4, source 4/4** in one call (component stack is fiber-only → Reticle-only) |

**The one number to chase is RRE** (Regression-Run Efficiency): a test suite's job is the SAME verification over and over. Reticle pays ~author-once + N×(~47–175 tok); a screenshot/DOM agent pays N×(~30k LLM re-drive). At a 4-flow suite that is already **2574×**, and the gap grows with every flow and every run — this is the only place a within-field 100× is physically real.

## Where Playwright / DevTools win (the honest "vice versa")

Reticle is **not** strictly better. Being inside the page costs it real browser-level fidelity. These are genuine competitor advantages — stated so the benchmark can't be accused of cherry-picking:

| Dimension | Why the competitor wins | Reticle's position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trusted input** (`isTrusted`) | Playwright drives real CDP input — native keyboard/mouse, file pickers, drag — `isTrusted:true`. | Reticle defaults to occlusion-honest **synthetic** dispatch; real input is opt-in (CDP) only. |
| **Real pixels** (visual ground truth) | A screenshot is the actual rendered frame — font-load failures, paint order, GPU/compositing bugs. **Measured:** a stray `filter` re-tint changed 2.3% of pixels — a screenshot-diff CAUGHT it; Reticle's always-on `inspect` MISSED it (computed style identical). (`visual-regression-bench`) | Reticle reads **computed style/geometry**, not paint — it can miss a bug that only shows in pixels. Reticle closes this only when DRIVEN: its opt-in `reticle_visual_diff` (CDP) caught the same regression — the always-on SDK can't. |
| **No app cooperation** | Tests any site with zero install. | Reticle must embed `@reticlehq/browser` (dev-only) — can't test a third-party site you don't own. |
| **Browser-level scope** | Multi-tab/popups, cross-origin, downloads, auth dialogs, and network **mock/intercept** (`route`/`fulfill`). | Reticle is single-page-runtime-scoped; it observes network but mocking is the app's job. |
| **Cross-engine** | Runs WebKit / Firefox / Chromium. | Reticle runs on whatever engine the app runs. |

**Measured reverse benchmark** (a loss measured, not asserted): **pixel/paint** — a stray `filter:hue-rotate(90deg) saturate(1.6)` on `html` re-tints the whole rendered page, changing **21,393 pixels (2.3%)** but leaving every computed-style prop Reticle reads (`color`/`backgroundColor`/`opacity`/ geometry) byte-identical. Result: a screenshot-diff **CAUGHT** it (`matched:false`); Reticle's always-on `reticle_inspect` **MISSED** it (signals identical). This is the screenshot's home turf — Playwright catches it natively. Reticle matches the catch **only when DRIVEN**: its opt-in `reticle_visual_diff` (CDP) produced the same `matched:false` verdict. The always-on, no-install SDK is computed-style, not pixels — and that's the honest boundary. (`visual-regression-bench`)

## When to use Reticle — and when to reach for Playwright / DevTools (by persona)

Reticle is not a Playwright replacement; it is the **inner-loop verification layer for an agent building an app it owns**. Pick by who you are and what you're doing:

| Persona / situation | Use | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coding agent (Claude Code) building a React/Next app you own** — verify each edit | **Reticle** | In-loop, ~100 tok/check, sees program state + source `file:line`, refuses destructive clicks. The loop it's built for. |
| **Regression suite you re-run on every commit / in CI** | **Reticle** | Deterministic replay: 0% flake, ~47–175 tok/run, 128–2574× cheaper than re-driving with an LLM. This is the decisive win. |
| **Bug whose truth is in state, not the DOM** (UI-vs-store desync, double-submit, an action's side-effect, a silent console error, a wasted-render storm) | **Reticle** | No out-of-page tool can see these at all — they live in the program, not the rendered page. |
| **Testing a third-party site you don't own / can't modify** | **Playwright** | Reticle must embed a dev-only SDK; it can't instrument code you don't ship. |
| **Cross-browser matrix** (WebKit, Firefox, Chromium) | **Playwright** | Reticle runs on whatever engine the app runs; it doesn't drive multiple engines. |
| **Trusted native input** (file pickers, drag-drop, real keyboard, `isTrusted:true`) | **Playwright** | Reticle defaults to synthetic dispatch; real input is opt-in (CDP) only. |
| **Pixel/paint visual regression** (font-load, paint order, GPU/compositing) | **Playwright** (or Reticle **driven**) | A screenshot is the rendered frame; Reticle's always-on read is computed-style, not pixels. Reticle matches only via opt-in `reticle_visual_diff`. |
| **Protocol-level network/perf debugging on any site** (CDP traces, throttling) | **DevTools** | DevTools MCP speaks raw CDP; Reticle observes app-level network, not the protocol. |
| **Multi-tab / popups / cross-origin / downloads / network mocking** | **Playwright** | Browser-level scope Reticle (single-page-runtime) doesn't own. |

**Rule of thumb:** if you **own the app and an agent is building it**, Reticle is the cheap, deterministic, state-aware inner loop — and the regression suite that never goes flaky. If you're **driving someone else's site, many engines, real input, or true pixels**, that's Playwright/DevTools territory. Many teams use **both**: Reticle for the build-verify-regress loop, Playwright for cross-browser/e2e release gates.

## The in-source advantages (why Reticle sees what outside tools can't)

The DOM is a lossy projection of the program. Sitting in the runtime + source map, Reticle reads the program itself. The structural advantages, each tied to a measured row above where one exists:

1. **Program state** — store / React state / props / context / memoized values (state/UI-desync 2/2, `state` oracle, and the **blast-radius** invariant: an action's unintended store side-effect on an unrendered view — impossible for any DOM tool).
2. **The app's own events** — domain signals vs inferring intent from DOM churn (signal predicate).
3. **Causality** — what an action _caused_ (effects/mutations/requests), not just before/after DOM; e.g. a `net { count }` consequence catches a double-submit a presence check passes (network-cardinality row).
4. **Time** — freeze/advance the app's clock; verify time-gated flows instantly + deterministically (time-travel row).
5. **Source coordinates** — fiber → component → `file:line` (the agent-fix-loop). _Caveat: host-element `data-reticle-source` is a DOM attr a competitor can also read; the component identity/tree is fiber-only._
6. **Determinism over repeated runs (RRE + flake rate)** — replay with no LLM; constant-size verdict (128–184× per run, 420×+ at suite scale) AND **0% verdict flake across 8 identical runs** — a CI gate diffs the verdict exactly (`replay-determinism`).
7. **Semantic action safety** — Reticle refuses a destructive action ("Deploy", "Delete") without `confirmDangerous`; an outside tool clicks anything blindly.
8. **Render behavior** — the React commit stream (wasted-render storms / thrashing) an outside tool cannot observe at all; Reticle reads the commit rate (`__reticle_renders`).

## Caveats (so the data isn't oversold)

- `o200k` is an OpenAI BPE proxy (≈ Anthropic text tokens ±~20%), except Layer B which uses authoritative model `usage`. Image-token comparisons vs screenshot agents are directional. (`METRIC.md`)
- Layer B is one model (gpt-4o), one turn budget, 5 scenarios; the token ratio is structural, accuracy could shift.
- The UI-bug-bench competitor results were corrected for apparatus artifacts (MCP init timeout, a nav badge mismatch, result-parsing) before reporting — see `UI-BUG-BENCH.md`. Three Reticle bugs were fixed while building it (`reticle_inspect` occlusion/cursor, `reticle_state` validation, design-token `offTheme`).

## Reproduce

`pnpm bench` (deterministic Layer C, fast) · `pnpm bench:full` (+ Layer A) · `pnpm bench:gate` (fail on regression vs the last `history.jsonl` row). UI-bug suite: `node bench/harness/visual-bug-bench.mjs` · reverse case (screenshot wins, needs `reticle drive`): `node bench/harness/visual-regression-bench.mjs` · double-submit (net count:1): `node bench/harness/network-cardinality-bench.mjs` · forbidden-call (net count:0): `node bench/harness/forbidden-call-bench.mjs` · clean console: `node bench/harness/console-clean-bench.mjs` · blast radius: `node bench/harness/state-blast-radius-bench.mjs` · flake rate: `node bench/harness/replay-determinism.mjs` and `node bench/harness/state-desync-bench.mjs`. Layer B needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
