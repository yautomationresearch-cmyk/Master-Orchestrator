# UI-bug benchmark (visual + state) — brutally honest

> Tougher bugs than the Layer-A suite: each leaves the element PRESENT with the correct role + name, so a DOM/a11y snapshot reports "fine." Fair 3-tool comparison — each tool observes its NATIVE way. Reported with no flattering: where a competitor matches Reticle, it is said plainly. Harness: `harness/visual-bug-bench.mjs`; injector: `apps/bench-app/src/reticle-bug-injector.ts`; raw: `raw/visual-bug-bench.json`.

## Batch 1 — visually-broken / off-theme but DOM-present (DETECTION PARITY, ergonomic gap)

Six bugs where the element renders with the right role/name but is broken: `cursor-missing` (dead pointer), `invisible` (opacity:0), `zero-size` (0×0), `occluded` (transparent z-index overlay), `color-regression` (silent recolor), `theme-violation` (off-design-token color). The `+NN JS` is the evaluate function the competitor agent must author and send; Reticle sends only `{ref}` (~5 tok).

| bug | Reticle (`reticle_inspect`) | Playwright (`browser_evaluate`) | DevTools (`evaluate_script`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cursor-missing | ✓ 225 tok | ✓ 272 tok (+117 JS) | ✓ 49 tok (+117 JS) |
| invisible | ✓ 233 | ✓ 272 (+118) | ✓ 49 (+118) |
| zero-size | ✓ 229 | ✓ 275 (+118) | ✓ 49 (+118) |
| occluded | ✓ 233 | ✓ 275 (+118) | ✓ 49 (+118) |
| color-regression | ✓ 230 | ✓ 272 (+118) | ✓ 46 (+118) |
| theme-violation | ✓ 280 (native `offTheme`) | ✓ 399 (**+259 JS**) | ✓ 35 (**+259 JS**) |
| **detection** | **6/6** | **6/6** | **6/6** |

**Honest verdict: this class does NOT differentiate Reticle on capability — it's a clean tie.** Any tool with a JS-evaluate escape hatch can read `getComputedStyle`/geometry/`elementFromPoint`, and (for theme) enumerate `:root` tokens, and catch all six. The earlier-looking "Reticle wins" was apparatus artifacts (a competitor MCP init timeout; a DevTools accessible-name nav missing the `Deployments500` badge) — fixed; corrected result is a tie.

Reticle's edge here is **ergonomic, and it grows with bug complexity** — one native `inspect` returns cursor/opacity/box/occlusion/color/`offTheme` with **no JS authoring**, surfaced in the default element observation, whereas the competitor must (1) suspect the bug, (2) know what to check, and (3) author a correct probe. For a simple computed-style read that probe is ~118 JS tokens; for **theme compliance it is 259 JS tokens** (enumerate every `:root` token, resolve each to rgb, test membership) that an agent is unlikely to write unprompted. Real, but an ergonomics/Layer-B argument, not a capability gap — and reported as such.

## Batch 2 — state/UI desync (THE CAPABILITY GAP — Reticle only), now a CLASS of 2

The bugs a DOM tool fundamentally cannot catch: the UI renders a plausible, self-consistent value that **contradicts the app's state**. Catching either needs a **source of truth** — the store — which the in-source tool reads and an outside-the-page tool cannot. Two distinct instances, so this is a class of Reticle-only catches, not one case. Harness: `harness/state-desync-bench.mjs`; raw: `raw/state-desync-bench.json`.

- **`state-desync` (a COUNT lies)** — the Deployments nav badge is forced to `0` while the store keeps the real count (`200`). A number on screen looks like a valid empty state.
- **`status-stale` (a STATUS lies)** — the top deployment row renders status `live` (correct green tone + dot, fully self-consistent) while the store holds `queued`. A screenshot/a11y tool sees a healthy, shipped deploy; only the store reveals the deploy never shipped.

| instance | Reticle (`reticle_state` + read displayed) | Playwright (`browser_evaluate`) | DevTools (`evaluate_script`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| state-desync | **CAUGHT** — store 200 ≠ shown 0, 47 tok | **missed** — truth=null, 278 tok +152 JS | **missed** — truth=null, 21 tok +152 JS |
| status-stale | **CAUGHT** — store `queued` ≠ shown `live`, 67 tok | **missed** — truth=null, 325 tok +187 JS | **missed** — truth=null, 21 tok +187 JS |
| **detection** | **2/2** | **0/2** | **0/2** |

**Honest verdict: this is a true capability gap, not ergonomics.** Both competitors genuinely tried to find a source of truth — their evaluate probes `window.store` / `window.useApp` / `__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__` and any `getState()` — and found nothing, because the store is registered with Reticle (`registerStore`), not exposed on a global. They read the displayed value correctly (`0`, `live`) but have **nothing to compare it against**, so a lying UI looks valid. Reticle reads the registered store directly and flags each mismatch in one call, at a fraction of the cost.

> Apparatus note (brutal-honest): the first `status-stale` run scored Reticle a _miss_ — the harness read `reticle_inspect.name` (empty for a table row, which has no aggregated accessible name) instead of `reticle_inspect.text` (the visible text Reticle already returns). The capability was present; the measurement read the wrong field. Corrected, then re-run. No Reticle code changed to make it pass.

This is where Reticle's in-source position is decisive: **batch 1 (visual/computed-style) is parity — any tool with an evaluate can read computed style; batch 2 (state/UI desync) is Reticle-only — no amount of DOM/JS reaches state the app never put in the DOM.** That is the honest 100×-class differentiator: not "Reticle sees pixels better," but "Reticle sees the program, and the program is the source of truth."

The honest meta-finding: **Reticle's unique capability is detecting UI-vs-state desync.** Everything a user can see (DOM, computed style, network) is parity with any evaluate-capable tool. That precise boundary — not an inflated "Reticle wins everything" — is the value of this dataset.

_Token figures are the `o200k` proxy used across the benchmark; "+NN JS" is the agent-authored evaluate function the competitor must send (Reticle sends only `{ref}`). All cells are genuine observations (no missing/error) — verified in `raw/visual-bug-bench.json`._
