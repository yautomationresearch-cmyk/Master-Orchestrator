  Develops and executes Spark code on Dataproc Clusters and Serverless.
  Reads and writes data using BigLake Iceberg catalogs, BigQuery and Spanner.
  Debugs execution failures.
  Use when:
  - Writing Spark ETL pipelines on GCP.
  - Training or running inference with ML models with spark on GCP.
  - Managing Spark clusters, jobs, batches, and interactive sessions.
  Don't use when:
  - Writing generic Python scripts that don't use Spark.
  - Performing simple SQL queries that can be done directly in BigQuery.

# Spark on Dataproc

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> You MUST ALWAYS follow the Task Execution Workflow when writing spark code.

## Task Execution Workflow

1.  **Understand schemas**: **ALWAYS** use `@skill:discovering-gcp-data-assets`
    skill or `references/schema_direct_inspection.md` to understand input and
    output schemas. Include the schema in your thought process BEFORE generating
    any code. Do NOT guess column names. Unless explicitly specified, assume
    that the assets are located in the same project. Avoid scanning for assets
    across other projects as it can take a long time. If an expected dataset or
    table does not exist, use `@skill:discovering-gcp-data-assets` to discover
    all similar tables in the namespace or project.

    *MINOR TYPO RULE*: If there is a minor typo (e.g. `employees` vs
    `employee`), you can fix the error and proceed.

    *STRICT HALT RULE*: If the discovered table names differ from the requested
    table by more than a minor typo (e.g. completely different words, prefixes,
    or suffixes), you must IMMEDIATELY report the missing table and a neutral
    list of all available alternatives in the same namespace to the user without
    making any recommendations. You MUST ask the user which alternative to use
    and then STOP EXECUTING your turn. Do NOT write any Spark code or notebooks.
    Do NOT proceed with code generation, do NOT add fallback logic to code, and
    do NOT automatically substitute any alternative table (even if its schema
    seems to match) without explicit user permission.
2.  **Verify source accessibility**: verify access/existence using `gcloud
    storage ls gs://<path-to-dataset>`. If accessing or reading a GCS path fails
    with a storage error e.g., permission errors like `403
    Forbidden`/`Forbidden`/`PermissionDenied`, or location errors like `404 Not
    Found`/`NotFound`/`FileNotFoundException` you should report the error
    immediately. Either (1) ask the user what to do next, or (2) if asked to
    execute a notebook, save the notebook with the error output and recommend
    next steps to resolve the issue. Do NOT scan all buckets for alternative
    fallback datasets when encountering GCS errors.
3.  **Generate spark code**:

    *   **Output Format**: **ALWAYS** generate code in **Python Notebooks
        (.ipynb)** format. Generate scripts (.py) only if explicitly requested.
    *   **Read and Write data**: **ALWAYS** Refer to
        `references/read_write_data.md` when reading or writing data.
    *   **ML Tasks**: Refer to `@skill:ml-best-practices` skill and
        `references/ml_tasks.md` when generating ML code.
    *   **Spark Optimizations**: **ALWAYS** refer to
        `references/spark_optimizations.md` when generating spark code and apply
        optimization whenever applicable.
4.  **Verify schema before write**: **ALWAYS** verify that the dataframe and
    destination schema match, use `df.printSchema()` for dataframe schema and
    refer to `@skill:discovering-gcp-data-assets` skill or
    `references/schema_direct_inspection.md` to verify destination schema.
5.  **Compile code before executing**: For notebooks convert them to python
    script using `jupyter nbconvert --to script your-notebook.ipynb` first. Then
    compile the resulting python script using `python3 -m py_compile
    your-script.py`. The same can be done for pyspark source code.
6.  **Execute script**: When requested to run a job, script, session refer to
    `references/gcloud_dataproc.md` on how to execute generated code on Managed
    Spark. This DOES NOT apply when generating notebooks.

## Common Mistakes Checklist

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Ensure you verify this checklist to avoid mistakes

Before submitting a job, verify:

-   [ ] **All imports present** (`col`, `when`, `lit`, etc. from
    `pyspark.sql.functions`)
-   [ ] **`vector_to_array` from correct module** use `from pyspark.ml.functions
    import vector_to_array` (NOT `pyspark.sql.functions`)
-   [ ] **DataFrame schema matches target Iceberg table** verify with
    `df.printSchema()` before writing
-   [ ] **CSV files read with `header` and `inferSchema`** without these, the
    header row becomes data and all columns are strings
-   [ ] **Driver memory safety (`toPandas()` / `collect()`)** NEVER call
    `.toPandas()` or `.collect()` on raw or un-aggregated DataFrames. ALWAYS
    perform transformations, aggregations (`groupBy().agg()`), or data reduction
    (`limit()`, `sample()`) in Spark before converting small summaries to Pandas
    for plotting or display.
-   [ ] **No inline pip install in Spark jobs**: NEVER run pip install or
    subprocess package installations inside PySpark scripts. Pass dependencies
    using --properties=spark.jars.packages=...,
    --archives=gs://.../env.tar.gz#environment, --py-files, or a custom
    --container-image.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## IAM Requirements

The Dataproc service account needs:

*   `roles/dataproc.worker`: Job execution
*   `roles/biglake.admin`: Iceberg table management
*   `roles/bigquery.jobUser`: Query materialization
*   `roles/storage.objectUser`: Read/write GCS
*   `roles/spanner.databaseUser`: Spanner writes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Spark resource management

Refer to `references/gcloud_dataproc.md` for detailed guidelines on managing
Spark clusters, jobs, batches, and interactive sessions.
