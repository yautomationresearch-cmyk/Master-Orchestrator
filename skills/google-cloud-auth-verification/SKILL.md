# Google Cloud Authentication Guidelines

## Mandatory Pre-Flight Execution & Auth Hierarchy

> [!IMPORTANT] **Pre-Flight Execution Priority Order**: Before generating code,
> implementation plans, or executing tasks for any GCP or Notebook workload:
>
> 1.  **Verify Shell, Script & Notebook Credentials**: If shell-based commands,
>     local Python scripts, or notebook kernels (`gs://...`, BigQuery, Dataproc)
>     are required, verify credentials via bundled probe (`gcloud auth list &&
>     gcloud config list`) or Application Default Credentials (ADC).
> 2.  **Distinguish Authentication vs. IAM Permissions**:
>     -   If `gcloud auth list` returns `No credentialed accounts`, **HARD
>         STOP** immediately and instruct the user to run `gcloud auth login`
>         and `gcloud auth application-default login`.
>     -   If Python throws `google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError`,
>         explicitly direct the user to run `gcloud auth application-default
>         login`.
>     -   If `gcloud auth list` shows an active credentialed account but a
>         BigQuery/GCP call returns `403 Forbidden: Access Denied`, **DO NOT**
>         tell the user to log in again with `gcloud auth login`. Diagnose
>         missing IAM roles (e.g., `roles/bigquery.dataEditor`) on the active
>         account.
> 3.  **HARD STOP if Unauthenticated**: If no active GCP credentials or valid
>     `gcloud` authentication are detected, **STOP IMMEDIATELY**. Prompt the
>     user to run `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default
>     login`. Do NOT attempt local virtualenv creation, package installation, or
>     local binary/JDK setup loops as workarounds.

## Common Error Messages

1.  **gcloud/bq CLI**:
    -   `ERROR: (bq) You do not currently have an active account selected.`
    -   `No credentialed accounts.`
    -   `Configuration error: No account is currently active.`
2.  **Execution Failures (Python/Notebooks)**:
    -   `google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: Could not automatically
        determine credentials.`
    -   `Forbidden: 403 Access Denied` (when it's clearly an auth issue).

## Verification Step

Before asking the user to log in, independently verify authentication status
using a single bundled probe command:

```bash
gcloud auth list --format="json" && gcloud config list --format="json"
```

*   If the output contains `No credentialed accounts.` or missing active
    account, proceed to **Corrective Action**.
*   If an account *is* listed but the user still receives a `403 Access Denied`
    error, the issue is likely **IAM permissions** (e.g., missing BigQuery
    roles) on their active account, rather than missing authentication. In this
    case, investigate permissions rather than asking them to log in again.

## Corrective Action

When missing credentials are confirmed, **DO NOT** attempt to fix credentials
via code or local virtualenv workarounds. Credentials must be established by the
user.

**Stop and ask the user to run the following commands in their terminal:**

1.  **To authenticate the gcloud CLI**: `gcloud auth login`
2.  **To set up Application Default Credentials (ADC)** (required for BQ CLI AND
    most libraries/notebooks): `gcloud auth application-default login`

## Post-Login Verification

After the user confirms they have logged in, verify with: `gcloud auth list`
Then proceed with the original task.
